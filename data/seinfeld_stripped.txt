  Wouldnt it be great if you could ask a woman what shes thinking

  Hug is definitely good
  Sure
  Although what if its one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching the hips are eight feet apart
  Thats so brutal I hate that
  You know how they do that
  Thats why you know a shake is bad
  Shake is bad but what if its the twohander The hand on the bottom the hand on the top the warm look in the eyes
  Hand sandwich

  I swear I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking I dont get it okay I I I admit I Im not getting the signals I am not getting it Women theyre so subtle their littleeverything they do is subtle Men are not subtle we are obvious Women know what men want men know what men want what do we want We want women thats it Its the only thing we know for sure it really is We want women How do we get them Oh we dont know bout that we dont know The next step after that we have no idea This is why you see men honking carhorns yelling from construction sites These are the best ideas weve had so far The carhorn honk is that a beauty Have you seen men doing this What is this The man is in the car the woman walks by the front of the car he honks Eeeehh eehhh eehhh This man is out of ideas How does it Eeeeeeehhhh I dont think she likes me The amazing thing is that we still get women dont we Men I mean men are with women You see men with women How are men getting women many people wonder Let me tell you a little bit about our organization Wherever women are we have a man working on the situation right now Now he may not be our best man okay we have a lot of areas to cover but someone from our staff is on the scene Thats why I think men get frustrated when we see women reading articles like Where to meet men Were here we are everywhere Were honking our horns to serve you better
  So Im on line at the supermarket Two women in front of me One of them her total was eight dollars the other three dollars They both of course choose to pay by the use of the
  Cheque
  Cheque Now the fact is if its a woman in front of you thats writing the cheque you will not be waiting long I have noticed that women are very fast with cheques yknow cause they write out so many cheques The keys they can never find in their purse they dont know where that is but the cheque book they got that They never fumble for the cheque book The cheque book comes out of a holster Jerry draws imaginary book from a holster Who do I make it out to Theres my ID Theres something about a cheque that to a man is not masculine I dont know exactly what it is I think to a man a cheque is like a note from your mother that says I dont have any money but if youll contact these people Im sure theyll stick up for me If you just trust me this one time I dont have any money but I have these I wrote on these Is this of any value at all
  Whats that one

  sarcastically Yeah Levine And Im Jerry Cougar Mellencamp Anyway I admit it was a fairly ridiculous thing to do but I mean I mean obviously we have a little problem here
  Yeah obviously
  I mean if were gonna be friends we gotta be able to talk about other people
  Couldnt agree more
  Good
  Good
  Good
  Great
  Great Where do you get great
  Its great to talk about other people
  Guys
  Yeah
  Uhhuh Yeah So anybody specific
  No A general guy
  Oh really Elaine Marie Benes
  What No its not a big deal
  No thats great Thats terrific
  No we just met
  Doesnt matter Whats the young mans name I would like to meet him
  Hmmm I dont think so
  Well what does he do Is he an artisan a craftsman a labourer of some sort
  Wall street
  Ah high finance Bulls Bears people from Conneticut
  And he happens to be pretty good lookin
  pause All right sir
  And hes hilarious
  Now thats not fair So where did you meet this guy
  I staked out his health club
  Uh huh When youre on a stakeout do you find its better to stand up against the wall or kinda crouch down behind a big plant
  Yknow I think that even if youve had a relationship with someone or lets say especially if youve had a relationship with someone and you try to become friends afterwards its very difficult Isnt this Its hard Because you know each other so well you know all of each others tricks Its like two magicians trying to entertain each other The one goes Look a rabbit The other goes So I believe this is your card Look why dont we just saw each other in half and call it a night okay
  So I move into the centre lane now I get ahead of this women who felt for some reason I guess that she thought that I cut her off So she pulls up along side of me gives me the finger It seems like such an arbitrary ridiculous thing to just pick a finger and you show it to the person Its a finger what does it mean Someone shows me one of their fingers and Im supposed to feel bad Is that the way its supposed to work I mean you could just give someone the toe really couldnt you I would feel worse if I got the toe than if I got the finger Cause its not easy to give someone the toe youve gotta get the shoe off the sock off and drive get it up and Jerry pretends to drive with one foot in the air giving the toe Look at that toe buddy He puts his foot down I mean thats really insulting to get the toe isnt it
  Is that it Got the cue tips got the miniumbrella something boring to read on the plane Jerry zips his bag ceremoniously Thats it Done
  claps her hands That is the single greatest packing performance I have ever seen
  proudly I amthe master packer
  laughs Yeah right youre the master packer
  What you must understand Elaine picking up the umbrella packing is no different than leading men into battle Jerry hits his bag rhythmically with his umbrella Youve gotta know the strengths and weaknesses of every soldier in that platoon From a collapsible toothbrush to a pair of ordinary black socks
  raising her hand Scuse me master packer
  Yes
  Just gimme your keys
  All right sir He tosses Elaine his keys The apartment buzzer goes off Jerry presses the first button to the intercom George
  from the intercom Yeah
  Okay so now is there anything else I need to know about this place
  Uh yeah the uh hot water takes a little while to come on So the best thing to do is to turn it on do all your shopping you come back and take a shower
  Okay this is quite a place
  Theres more The refrigerator
  Deduct a minimum of two days off all expiration dates He uses the umbrella to point to certain compartments in the fridge No meat no leftovers no butter He closes the fridge And I cannot overstate this No soft cheeses of any kind Is that clear

  Most men like working on things Tools objects fixing things This is what men enjoy doing Have you ever noticed a guys out in his driveway working on something with tools how all the other men in the neighborhood are magnetically drawn to this activity They just come wandering out of the house like zombies Men its true men hear a drill its like a dog whistle Just his head perks up you know they go running up to that living room curtain Honey I think Jims working on something over there So they run over to the guy Now they dont actually help the guy No they just want to hang around the area where work is being done Thats what men want to do We want to watch the guy we want to talk to him we want to ask him dumb questions You know What are you using a Phillipshead You know we feel involved Thats why when they have construction sites they have to have those wood panel fences around it thats just to keep the men out They cut those little holes for us so we can see what the hell is going on But if they dont cut those holes we are climbing those fences Right over there What are you using the steel girders down there Yeah thatll hold
  I had to say something chuckles I had to say something Everything was going so well I had to say something

  Ah mint
  Of course So Im looking at it I look up I see shes looking at it Our eyes lock It was a horrible moment I just
  So let me get this straight She saw the floss you panicked and you told her you liked her
  If I didnt put that floss in my pocket Id be crawling around her bedroom right now looking for my glasses
  And youre sure the floss was the catalyst
  Yes I am
  You dont think it mightve had anything to do with that

  Oh no Thats impossible Id rather lie to him for the rest of my life that go through that again He was crying Tears Accompanied by mucus
  You made a man cry Ive never made a man cry I even kicked a guy in the groin once and he didnt cry I got the cab
  Couple of tough monkeys
  Oh hi Elaine hey to Jerry Hey you missed a great game tonight buddy
  Game
  Knick game Horneck took me We were sitting two rows behind the bench Were getting hit by sweat
  Wait How does Horneck know you
  Last week When I you know gave you the phone Hes really into my pizza place idea
  This is too much
  Wait what pizza place idea
  Oh no
  You get to make your own pie
  Oh that sounds like a great idea It would be fun
  Yea
  from the hallway Kramer
  Yeah
  Perfect
  Hey
  Okay who wants meatloaf
  No thanks
  to Joel Its gonna be hot in a minute
  So I though you were tutoring your nephew
  Oh we finished early

  Elaine Benes this is Joel Horneck
  Hi
  Whoa Nelson This is Elaine I though you guys split
  Were still friends
  So thanks again for those tickets But next week Im going to take you How about next Tuesday night to Elaine And why dont you come along
  Oh no no Tuesdays uh no good becasue weve got choir practice

  WeWere doing that evening of Eastern European National Anthems

  Fortyone home games Lets see saturday night weve got the Mavericks If you dont like the Mavericks next Tuesday Lakers I mean you gotta like Magic right Lets see on the road on the road on the road on the road back on the fourteenth They play the Bulls You cant miss Air Jordan
  You know I really Ive come to the conclusion that there are certain friends in your life that theyre just always your friends and you have to accept it You see them you dont really wanna see them You dont call them they call you You dont call back they call again The only way to get through talking with people that you dont really have anything in common with is to pretend youre hosting your own little talk show This is what I do You pretend theres a little desk around you The only problem with this is theres no way you can say Hey its been great having you on the show Were out of time
  Went out to dinner the other night Check came at the end of the meal as it always does Never liked the check at the end of the meal system because moneys a very different thing before and after you eat Before you eat money has no value And you dont care about money when youre hungry You sit down at a restaurant youre like the ruler of an empire More drinks appetizers quickly quickly It will be the greatest meal of our lives Then after the meal you know youve got the pants open youve got the napkins destroyed cigarette butt in the mashed potatoes Then the check comes at that moment People are always upset you know Theyre mystified by the check What is this How could this be They start passing it around the table Does this look right to you Were not hungry now Why are we buying all this food
  I think Superman probably has a very good sense of humor
  I never heard him say anything really funny
  But its common sense Hes got super strength super speed Im sure hes got super humor
  You would think that but either youre born with a sense of humor or youre not Its not going to change even if you go from the red sun of Krypton all the way to the yellow sun of the Earth
  Why Why would that one area of his mind not be affected by the yellow sun of Earth
  I dont know But he aint funny
  I know I know Im sorry Im late
  No problem
  I dropped a grape
  Pardon
  I dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared I couldnt find it I was I was literally on my knees for ten minutes looking for this stupid grape I have no idea where it went
  Were you crying I mean its just a grape Youll find it
  No Im just getting over an allergy attack This guy Im going out with
  Robert
  Robert Yes Thank you He has two cats and Im allergic to them You know I finally meet a normal man and I cant even go into his apartment you know And of course my apartment is the actors studio so we cant go there Its really causing a lot of problems you know He wont even go away for the weekend because of these cats

  balancing a spoon on her nose Hey why dont you take her to that place in Vermont I was telling you about You know that really charming place with the separate faucets for the hot and cold Shell love it
  Thats exquisite Listen uh if its not too much trouble could you pass me that paper over there

  George What Youre kidding Well whats wrong So what are we gonna do Great All right Ill speak to you later He hangs up Wilkinson the guy whos supposed to tell us when to sell the stock hes in the hospital
  So you dont know whats wrong with him
  All Simons was able to find out is that hes in the hospital
  Okay fine Has Simons been in touch with him
  Of course hes been in touch with him Hes left two messages He just hasnt heard back yet thats all
  Well this is it Im selling
  Just give it a little more time
  I never shouldve gotten involved in this Im a nervous wreck Im not cut out for investing
  All right all right Thats it Im gonna go down there
  Where
  To the hospital
  The hospital
  Im going to find out whats going on All right
  Are you nuts You dont even know the guy
  So what Ill start talking to him you know casual and Ill work my way around to it
  What if hes in an iron lung or something What are you gonna do Jerry knocks on imaginary glass How you feeling Mr Wilkinson He makes a hissing sound By the way whats happening with Sendrax
  Maybe hes resting
  Who goes to the hospital to rest
  What are you a doctor
  Okay fine fine When are you going down there
  Today Im going today Just dont do anything until you hear from me
  All right
  to the woman Boy I have to get to a bathroom
  to Jerry May I help you
  Yeah I picked up this shirt here yesterday Its completely shrunk Theres absolutely no way I can wear it
  When did you bring it in
  Whats the difference Look at it Do you see the size of this shirt
  You got a receipt
  I cant find the receipt
  You should get the receipt
  Look forget about the receipt all right Even if I had the receipt look at it Its a hand puppet What am I gonna do with this
  Yes but how do I know we did the shirt
  What do you think this is a little scam I have I take this tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money In fact forget the money I dont even want the money I just once I would like to hear a dry cleaner admit that something was their fault Thats what I want I want an admission of guilt
  Maybe you asked for it to be washed
  No Drycleaned
  Let me explain to you something okay With certain types of fabrics different chemicals can react causing
  You shrunk it You know you shrunk it Just tell me that you shrunk it
  looks around making sure not too many people are listening I shrunk it
  I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I can say to the dry cleaner Well its ruined And of course the dry cleaner can respond Its not our fault Were not responsible We just ruin the clothes That ends our legal obligation You see the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this is actually possible ThRight Theyre cleaning our clothes but theyre not getting anything wet Its all dry I know theres gotta be some liquids back there some fluids that theyre using Theres no such thing as dry cleaning When you get something on your shirt ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that Jerry brushes off his shirt Thats dry cleaning I dont think thats what theyre doing back there They dont have eighty guys going Come on hurry up Theres a lot of shirts today
  Bless you
  Thank you What evidence is there that cats are so smart anyway Huh What do they do Because theyre clean I am sorry My Uncle Pete showers four times a day and he cant count to ten so dont give me hygiene

  No I just have a cold
  So what ever happened with that
  I gave him an ultimatum
  He chose the cats
  Theyre very clean animals
  I gotta say thats pretty sad Losing out to a cat
  Almost as bad as losing out to a perfume
  I told you those trips were relationship killers Too bad you cant get your buddy Superman to fly around the Earth at super speed and reverse time Youd get all the money back you could have avoided the whole trip to Vermont
  Superman can go back in time
  We went over that
  Pst moves in close with Elaine and Jerry Wilkinsons got a bite on a new one Petramco Corp Out of uh Springfield I think Theyre about to introduce some sort of a robot butcher
  A robot butcher
  Shhhhh If you want to get in theres very little time calling to the waitress Sweetheart Waitress approaches and tears off a check George stops her No no no That ought to cover it He hands her some money she turns to leave George stops her Just a second Just a let me juspeek He looks at the check then takes some money out of her hand George urges Jerry and Elaine to eat Come on come on come on
  Im not an investor People always tell me you should have your money working for you Ive decided Ill do the work Im gonna let the money relax You know what I mean Cause you send your money out there  working for you  a lot of times it gets fired You go back there What happened I had my money It was here it was working for me Yeah I remember your money Showing up late Taking time off We had to let him go
  Im always in traffic with the lane expert You know this type of person Constantly reevaluating their lane choice Never quite sure Is this the best lane for me For my life Theyre always a little bit ahead of you Can I get in over there Could I get in over here Could I get in there Yeah come on over here pal Were zoomin over here This is the secret lane nobody knows about it The ultimate I think the ultimate psychological test of traffic is the total dead stop Not even rolling And you look out the window you can see gum clearly So we know that in the future traffic will get even worse than that I mean what will happen Will it start moving backwords I wonder I mean is that possible That someday well be going Jerry pretends hes driving in reverse Boy this is some really bad traffic now boy This is really bad Im gonna try to get off and get back on going the other way
  She cant kill me right
  No of course not
  People break up all the time

  Youre a human being
  And I didnt even ask her out She asked me out first She called me up What was I supposed to do Say no laughs I cant do that to someone
  Youre too nice a guy
  I am Im a nice guy And she seduced me We were in my apartment Im sitting on the couch shes on the chair I get up to go to the bathroom I come back shes on the couch What am I supposed to do Not do anything I couldnt do that I wouldve insulted her
  Youre flesh and blood
  I had nothing to do wtih any of this I met all her friends I didnt want to meet them I kept trying to avoid it I knew it would only get me in deeper But they were everywhere They kept popping up all over the place This is Nancy this is Susan this is Amy this is my cousin this is my brother this is my father Its like Im in quicksand

  You should just do it like a BandAid One motion Right off
  Hi
  Hi
  Hey what are you doing
  Im letting you in
  Oh no No I dont want to sit in the back Ill be left out of the conversation
  No you wont
  Yes I will George Ill have to stick my chin on top of the seat
  Okay
  Why cant you sit in the middle
  Please it doesnt look good Boy boy girl
  Youre afraid to sit next to a man Youre a little homophobic arent ya
  Is it that obvious
  Hello Jerry
  Hello
  Did you get a haircut
  No shower So where are we eating
  Tell me if you think this is strange Theres this guy who lives in my building who I was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend Hes a uh teacher or something Anyway after we met whenever wed run into each other on the street or in the lobby or whatever we would stop and we would chat a little Nothing much Little pleasantries Hes a nice guy hes got a family Then after a while I noticed there was not more stopping Just saying hello and continuing on our way And then the verbal hellos stopped and we just went into these little sort of nods of recognition So fine I figure thats where this relationship is finally gonna settle polite nodding Then one day he doesnt nod Like I dont exist He went from nods to nothing
  singing imitating Tony Bennett You know Id go from nods to nothing
  And now theres this intense animosity whenever we pass I mean its like we really hate each other Its based on nothing
  A relationship is an organism You created this thing and then you starved it so it turned against you Same thing happened in The Blob
  I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy Confront him
  Really
  Yes
  You would do that
  If I was a different person
  Hello Hello Is Glen there Im sorry Is this 8055553234 Yes I know I have the wrong number but I just want to know if I dialed wrong or if
  to the intercom Come on up
  to the phone Oh its you again See now if you had answered me I wouldnt have had to do this Now thats two long distance calls I made to you why cant you The guy hangs up on Jerry again to nobody Why Why do they just hang up like that Thank you very much
  Taste this
  No I just had a sandwich
  No taste it Taste it

  Jerry This is great cantaloupe
  all right
  Uhhuh Its good
  Its very good
  Good huh
  Good
  I got it at Joes
  Uhhuh
  Fortynine cents a pound Thats practically half than what youre paying at the supermarket I dont know why you dont go to Joes
  Its too far
  Its three blocks further You can use my shopping cart
  Im not pulling a shopping cart What am I suppose to wear a kerchief Put stockings on and roll em down below my knee
  See the other thing is if you dont like anything he takes it right back
  I dont return fruit Fruit is a gamble I know that going in
  Im outta there I did it Its over
  You did it What happened
  I told her In the kitchen  which was risky cause its near all the knives I started with the word Listen
  Uhhuh
  I said Listen Marlene and then the next thing I know Im in the middle of it And theres this voice inside of me going Youre doing it Youre doing it And then she started to cry and I weakened a bit I almost relented but the voice Jerry the voice said Keep going keep going Youre almost out Its like I was making a prison break you know and Im heading for the wall and I trip and I twist my ankle and they throw the light on you you know So somehow I get though the crying and I keep running Then the cursing started Shes firing at me from the guard tower Son of a bang Son of a boom I get to the top of the wall  the front door I opened it up Im one foot away I took one last look around the penitentiary and I jumped
  See its never as bad as you imagine
  I liked Marlene Whats her number
  Uh no I I dont think so
  to Kramer Could you stop that smacking
  George I want you to taste this cantaloupe
  Oh no thank you
  Its the best cantaloupe I ever had
  No really No no thanks
  Jerry tell him how good this cantaloupe is
  Its very good cantaloupe Kramer leaves to George So thats it Youre out
  Except for one small problem Hah I left some books in her apartment
  So go get them
  Oh no no I cant go back there Jerry its so awkward and you know it could be dangerous sexually Something could happen Id be right back where I started from
  So forget about the books Did you read them
  Well yeah
  What do you need them for
  I dont know Theyre books
  What is this obsession people have with books They put them in their houses like theyre trophies What do you need it for after you read it
  Theyre my books
  So you want me to get the books Is that it
  so it mustve been ninetyfive degrees that night and everyones just standing around the pool with little drinks in their hands I was wearing my old jeans and tshirt And I dont know I was just in one of those moods So I said to myself Marlene just do it And I jumped in And as Im getting out I feel all these eyes on me and I look up and everyone is just staring at me
  So whatd you do
  Well nothing Its no skin off my hide if people like to look I just didnt see what the big attraction was
  Well I have a general idea what it was I could take a guess
  Hey you know Jerry just because George and I dont see each other anymore it doesnt mean we shouldnt stay friends
  No
  Good enough Im really glad we got that settled
  I dont know how this happened
  Jerry its not my fault
  No no Its not your fault Books books I need my books Have you reread those books yet by the way You know the great thing When you read Moby Dick the second time Ahab and the whale become good friends You know its not like Marlenes a bad person or anything but my God I mean weve had like three lunches and a movie and she never stops calling George nods And its these meaningless purposeless blather calls She never asks if Im busy or anything I just pick up the phone and shes in the middle of a sentence
  Its standard Has she left you one of those messages where she uses up the whole machine
  disgusted Ohh You know and sometimes shell go imitates Marlene Hello Jerry And Ill go Oh hi Marlene And then its Jerry
  I dunno sometimes
  What trying to get off the phone
  more disgusted Ohhhh You cant Its impossible Theres no break in the conversation where you can go All right then You know it just goes on and on and on without a break in the wall I mean I gotta put a stop to this
  Just do it like a BandAid One motion Right off beat She is sexy though Dont you think
  Yeah Yes she is
  Mr Costanza

  The doctor will see you now
  to Jerry sarcastically Yeah doctor Im going to have to wait in that little room all by myself arent I He picks up a crossword puzzle I better take this I hate the little room George walks into the hallway that leads to the doctors office Oh hello Doctor
  The waiting room I hate when they make you wait in the room Cause it says Waiting Room Theres no chance of not waiting Cause they call it the waiting room theyre gonna use it Theyve got it Its all set up for you to wait And you sit there you know and youve got your little magazine You pretend youre reading it but youre really looking at the other people You know youre thinking about about them Things like I wonder what hes got As soon as she goes Im getting her magazine And then they finally call you and its a very exciting moment They finally call you and you stand up and you kinda look around at the other people in the room Well I guess Ive been chosen Ill see you all later You know so you think youre going to see the doctor but youre not are you No Youre going into the next waiting room  the littler waiting room But if they are you know doing some sort of medical thing to you you want to be in the smallest room that they have I think You dont wnat to be in the largest room that they have You know what I mean You ever see these operating theaters that they have with like stadium seating You dont want them doing anything to you that makes other doctors go I have to see this Are you kidding Are they really gonna do that to him Are there seats Can we get in Do they scalp tickets to these things I got two for the Winslow tumor I got two

  At least come and say hello have a cup of coffee then youll leave
  How come he gets to leave
  If I wind up sitting next to Uncle Leo I am leaving Hes always grabbing my arm when he talks to me I guess its because so many people have left in the middle of his conversation
  And its always about Jeffrey right
  Yeah He talks about him like he split the atom The kid works for the Parks Department
  Morty are you coming in
  Oh yeah I forgot all about it
  to Jerry Hey howd you do

  to Elaine Seriously do you wanna switch chairs

  Jerry are you listening to this
  Yeah Uncle Leo
  So so now the parks commissioner is recommending Jeffrey for a citation
  Right For the reducing of the pond scum
  No for the walking tours
  Oh yeah Where the people eat the plant life The edible foliage tour
  Thats exactly right He knows the whole history of the park For two hours hes talking and answering questions But you want to know something Whenever he has a problem with one of these highpowered big shots in the Parks Department you know who he calls
  Mickey Mantle
  saving Jerry from Leo Jerry Jerry Did you taste these peas to Manya These peas are great
  eating a forkful These peas are bursting with country fresh flavor
  Mmm phenomenal peas
  Are you ready for dessert
  Well actually we do have to kind of get going
  surprised Youre going
  Oh uh I dont really eat dessert Im dieting
  Yeah I cant eat dessert either The sugar makes my ankles swell up and I cant dance
  Cant dance
  Hes kidding Manya
  Is that a joke
  So did you hear Claires getting married
  Yeah yeah
  I hear the fella owns a couple of racehorses You know trotters like at Yonkers
  Horses Theyre like big riding dogs
  What about ponies What kind of abnormal animal is that And those kids who had their own ponies
  I know I hated those kids In fact I hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up
  angry I had a pony
  Well I didnt uh really mean a pony per se
  When I was a little girl in Poland we all had ponies My sister had pony my cousin had pony So whats wrong with that
  Nothing Nothing at all I was just merely expressing
  Should we have coffee Whos having coffee
  He was a beautiful pony And I loved him
  Well Im sure you did Who wouldnt love a pony Who wouldnt love a person that had a pony
  You You said so
  No see we didnt have ponies Im sure at that time in Poland they were very common They were probably like compact cars
  Thats it I had enough
  Have your coffee everybody Shes a little upset Its been an emotional day
  I didnt know she had a pony How was I to know she had a pony Who figures an immigrants going to have a pony Do you know what the odds are on that I mean in all the pictures I saw of immigrants on boats coming into New York harbor I never saw one of them sittin on a pony Why would anybody come here if they had a pony Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a nonpony country It doesnt make sense Am I wrong
  Ill drive you to the airport
  No were taking a cab
  I just hope that whole pony incident didnt put a damper on the trip
  Dont be ridiculous It was a misunderstanding
  Hey I agree with him Nobody likes a kid with a pony
  Well if you ever talk to her tell her Im sorry Elaine too She feels terrible
  You know you should give Manya a call
  Maybe I will
  Oh hi I uh just came to say goodbye
  Need any help with those
  Its nothing I got it So how are your levels coming along
  Oh well I decided Im not gonna do it
  laughing Really What a shock
  Goodbye Jerry
  Take care
  Well call you
  Bye Jer
  Bye Dad Take it easy
  Bye Mr Kramer
  Yeah So long Morty
  So when do I get my dinner
  Theres no dinner The bets off Im not gonna do it
  Yes I know youre not gonna do it Thats why I bet
  Ya well theres no bet if Im not doing it
  Thats the bet That youre not doing it
  Yeah well I could do it I dont wanna do it
  We didnt bet on if you wanted to We bet on if it would be done
  And it could be done
  Well of course it could be done Anything could be done But it only is done if its done Show me the levels The bet is the levels
  I dont want the levels
  Thats the bet The phone rings Jerry answers it Hello No oh hi Kramer leaves no they just left Oh my God hang on a second Maybe I can still catch em Jerry goes over to the window and opens it calling out the window Ma Ma Up here Dont get in the cab Manya died Manya died
  Who did you talk to
  Uncle Leo
  And whens the funeral
  I dont know He said hed call back
  You know what this means dont you We lost the Supersaver Those tickets are nonrefundable
  She just had a checkup The doctor said she was fine Unless
  What
  What Nothing
  You dont think What The pony remark
  Oh dont be ridiculous She was an old woman
  You dont think that I killed her
  You know what the flight backll cost us
  It was just an innocent comment I didnt know she had a pony
  Maybe we can get an army transport flight They got a base in Sarasota I think
  The whole thing was taking out of context It was a joke The phone rings Thats probably Uncle Leo
  Hello Yes I know Well its just one of those things Sure sure well see you then
  The funerals Wednesday
  Wednesday What what Wednesday
  Two o clock Wednesday
  Ah
  What
  Ive got the softball game on Wednesday Its the championship
  So Youre not obligated Go play in your game
  I didnt even know the woman
  So dont go
  I mean I met her three times I dont even know her last name
  Jerry no ones forcing you
  I mean who has a funeral on a Wednesday Thats what I want to know I mean its the championship Im hitting everything
  I dont have a dress to wear to Morty And you You dont have anything
  I got my sport jacket
  Youre not wearing that to a funeral
  Whats wrong with it
  It looks ridiculous
  What Im gonna buy a new sport jacket now
  I dont know what to do
  depressed You know what this funerals gonna wind up costing me Oh boy
  We dont understand death And the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow And uh I mean hey you know I think if you cant stretch out and get some solid rest at that point I dont see how bedding accessories really make the difference I mean they got the guy in a suit with a pillow Now is he going to a meeting or is he catching forty winks I mean lets make up our mind where we think theyre going
  I actually like ponies I was just trying to make conversation What times your game
  Two FortyFive
  And what times the funeral
  Two o clock
  How long does a funeral take
  Depends on how nice the person was But you gotta figure even Oswald took fortyfive minutes
  So you cant do both
  You know if the situation were reversed and Manya had some mahjongg championship or something I wouldnt expect her to go to my funeral I would understand
  How can you even consider not going
  You know Ive been thinking I cannot envision any circumstances in which Ill ever have the opportunity to have sex again Hows it gonna happen I just dont see how it could occur
  You know funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how Im actually gonna die someday Me dead Imagine that
  They always make me take stock of my life And how Ive pretty much wasted all of it and how I plan to continue wasting it
  I know and then you say to yourself From this moment on Im not gonna waste any more of it But then you go How What can I do thats not wasting it
  Is this a waste of time What should we be doing Cant you have coffee with people
  You know I cant believe youre even considering not playing We need you Youre hitting everything
  He has to go He may have killed her
  Me What about you You brought up the pony
  Oh yeah but I didnt say I hated anyone who had one
  to Jerry Whos going to play left field
  Bender
  Bender He cant play left He stinks I just dont see what purpose is it gonna serve your going I mean you think dead peole care whos at their funeral They dont even know theyre having a funeral Its not like shes hanging out in the back going I cant believe Jerry didnt show up
  Maybe shes there in spirit How about that
  If youre a spirit and you can travel to other dimensions and galaxies and find out the mysteries of the universe you think shes gonna wanna hang around Drexlers funeral home on Ocean Parkway
  George I met this woman She is not traveling to any other dimensions
  You know how easy it is for dead people to travel Its not like getting on a bus One second snaps his fingers Its all mental
  Fifty years they were married Now hes moving to Pheonix
  Phoenix Whats happening with his appartment
  I dont know Theyve been in there since like World War II The rents three hundred a month
  Three hundred a month Oh my God
  Although this may seem like a sad event it should not be a day of mourning For Manya had a rich fulfilling life She grew up in a different world  a simpler world  with loving parents a beautiful home in the country and from what I understand she eve had a pony Jerry throws up his hands Oh how she loved that pony Even in her declining years whenever she would speak of it her eyes would light up Its lustrous coat its flowing mane It was the pride of Krakow
  Well the games starting just about now
  It was good that the two of you came It was a nice gesture
  Im not a doctor yet Uncle Morty Im just an intern I cant write a note to an airline
  Youve got your degree They dont care They just want to see something
  I just wanted to say how sorry I was
  Jerry you wanna hear something Your cousin Jeffrey is switching parks Theyre transferring him to Riverside  so hell completely revamp that operation you understand
  Yeah
  Hell do in Riverside what he did in Central Park More money So thats your cousin
  You dont understand Ive never paid a full fare
  Once again I just want to say how sorry I am about the other night
  Oh me too
  Oh no no no She forgot all about that She was much more upset about the potato salad
  So I understand youre moving to Phoenix
  Yeah my brother lives there I think Manya wouldve liked Phoenix
  Mmm gorgeous exquisite town So whats happening with your apartment
  Of course its very hot there Ill have to get uh air conditioner
  Oh you can have mine Ill ship it out to you Isaac isnt listening to Elaine But what about that big apartment on West End Avenue
  Although they say its a dry heat
  Dry wet trying to get through to him whats happening with your apartment
  I dont even know if I should take my winter clothing
  I have an idea Leave the winter clothing in the apartment and Ill watch it for you and Ill live there and Ill make sure that nothing happens to it
  Oh the apartment Jeffreys taking the apartment
  Oh Jeffrey
  You know Jeffery
  Yeah from what I understand he works for the Parks Department
  Its raining
  Its raining Its raining The game will be postponed Well play tomorrow
  Believe me I wouldnt bother you if the army hadnt closed that base in Sarasota Here scribble a little something here
  I cant Ill get in trouble
  Oh for Gods sake
  Who gets picked off in softball Its unheard of
  Its never happened to me before
  I remember saying to myself Why is Jerry so far off the base
  Ill have to live with this shame for the rest of my life
  And then in the fifth inning why did you take off on the pop fly
  I thought there were two outs
  I couldnt believe it when I saw you running laughing I thought maybe they had changed the rules or something
  It was the single worst moment of my life
  smiling What about Sharon Besser
  Oh well of course Nineteenseventythree
  Makes you wonder though doesnt it
  Wonder about what
  You know looking up the spirit world
  You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex on me
  I never saw anyone play like that
  But I went to the funeral
  Yeah but that doesnt make up for killin her
  Maybe Manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting another galaxy that day
  Dont you think she woulda heard I was there
  Not necessarily
  Who figures and immigrants gonna have a pony
  What is the pony What is the point of the pony Why do we have these animals these ponies What do we do with them Besides the pony ride Why ponies What are we doing with them I mean police dont use them for you know crowd control Jerry crouches down and makes like hes riding a pony Hey uh you wanna get back behind the barricades Hey Hey little boy Yeah Im talking to you Behind the barricades So somebody I assume genetically engineered these ponies Do you think they could make them any size I mean could they make them like the size of a quarter if they wanted That would be fun for Monopoly though wouldnt it Just have a little pony and you put him on the Baltic thats two down go ahead Hold it Right there Baltic Yeah thats it Fine Right there hold it right there
  I hate clothes okay I hate buying them I hate picking them out of my closet I cant stand every day trying to come up with little outfits for myself I think eventually fashion wont even exist It wont I think eventually well all be wearing the same thing Cause anytime I see a movie or a TV show where theres people from the future or another planet theyre all wearing the same thing Somehow they decided This is going to be our outfit Onepiece silver jumpsuit Vstripe and boots Thats it We should come up for an outfit for Earth An Earth outfit We should vote on it Candidates propose different outfits No speeches They walk out twirl walk off We just sit in the audience and go That was nice I could wear that
  I think Ive seen enough
  Well I might have something in the back
  The back They never find anything in the back If they had anything good in the back theyd put it out in the front
  Why dont they open up an entire store for the back Call it Just Back All back No front You walk in the front youre immediately in the back Jerry picks up a tie display and shakes it rhythmically from left to right Look Elaine tie carwash
  Oh I just read that Thats terrific

  Well its a new suede jacket It might get ruined
  Well youre not going to walk down the street with me and my daughter dressed like that Thats for damn sure
  Its uh its only a few blocks
  to the intercom Elaine
  Yeah
  Come on up
  Hey
  Hey
  Ive gotta feed the birds
  So
  You got any of those mini Ritzes
  I cant believe I do
  Yeah Well are you going out
  Yeah
  Hey wheres your new jacket Jerry points to the jacket hanging in the bathroom Its ruined What Kramer enters the bathroom and sees the garment Ohhh What did you do to it
  I was out in the snow last night
  Dont you know what that does to suede
  I have an idea Elaine enters to Elaine We can make the ninethirty at Cinema Three
  Okay to Kramer Hello to Jerry Listen thanks again for coming last night Dad said he had a great time
  Is he still in town
  No hes driving back to Maryland tonight
  So uh what are you gonna do with that one now
  I dont know
  smiling Well
  to Jerry I didnt want to tell you this but usually he hates everyone
  Really
  You gonna throw this out
  Well I cant wear it
  Yeah he like you though Said you reminded him of somebody he knew in Korea
  to Jerry Well if youre just gonna throw it out you know I could take it
  Yeah go ahead take it
  Dad thinks George is gay
  Oh because of all the singing
  No he pretty much thinks everyone is gay
  Hey see I like it like this
  Isnt that Jerry nods Oh is this from the snow last night Jerry nods Ugh you know what you shouldve done You shouldve turned it inside out
  Ill try and remember that
  Boy its too bad you gave me this one too
  Yeah too bad
  Im gonna have to do something about this lining
  singing Master of the houseDoling out the charmReady with a handshake and an open palm
  I had a leather jacket that got ruined Now why does moisture ruin leather I dont get this Arent cows outside most of the time I dont understand it When its raining do cows go up to the farmhouse Let us in were all wearin leather Open the door Were gonna ruin the whole outfit here Is it suede I am suede the whole thing is suede I cant have this cleaned Its all I got
  The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is doing something better than what youre doing You ever see anybody on TV like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their face Some people have a little too much fun on television The soda commercial people Where do they summon this enthusiasm Have you seen them We have soda we have soda we have soda jumping laughing flying through the air Its a can of soda Have you ever been standing there and youre watching TV and youre drinking the exact same product that theyre advertising right there on TV and its like you know theyre spiking volleyballs jetskiing girls in bikinis and Im standing there Maybe Im putting too much ice in mine
  excited So then as we were leaving we were just kind of standing there and she was sort of smiling at me and I wasnt sure if she wanted me to ask her out because when women smile at me I dont know what it means Sometimes I interpret it like theyre psychotic or something and I dont know if Im supposed to smile back I dont know what to do So I just stood there like  remember how Quayle looked when Benson gave him that Kennedy line Thats what I looked like
  So you didnt ask
  No I froze
  Counter
  Oh yeah So wait wait A halfhour later Im back in the office I tell Lloyd the whole story He says So why dont you call her I says I cant I couldnt I couldnt do it right then For me to ask a woman out I gotta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks So Lloyd calls me a wuss
  He said wuss
  Yeah Anyway he shamed me into it
  So you called
  Right And and to cover my nervousness I started eating an apple because I think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone it makes you sound casual
  Yeah Like a farm boy
  Right So I call her up I tell her its me she gives me an enthusiastic Hi
  Wow The enthusiastic hi Thats beautiful
  Oh I dont get the enthusiastic hi Im outta there
  All right so youre chewing your apple you got your enthusiastic hi Go ahead
  So were talking and I dont like to go too long before I ask them out I wanna get it over with right away so I just blurt out What are you doing Saturday night
  And
  She bought
  Great day in the morning
  Then I got off the phone right away
  Sure its like robbing a bank You dont loiter around in front of the teller holding that big bag of money You come in you hit and get out
  Its amazing We we both have dates on the same night I cant remember the last time that happened
  I cant stand doing laundry Thats why I have forty pairs of underwear
  You do not
  Absolutely Because instead of doing a wash I just keep buying underwear My goal is to have over three hundred and sixty pair That way I only have to do wash once a year
  in an attempted Scottish accent Come on try it Let me hear you try a Scottish accent
  Thats Irish
  Irish Scottish whats the difference lassie
  So uh thanks for dinner It was great
  Yeah clears his throat We should do this again
  Would you like to come upstairs for some coffee
  Oh no thanks I cant drink coffee late at night it keeps me up
  confused by his response So um okay
  Okay
  Goodnight
  Yeah take it easy
  Thanks again for the movie
  Youre welcome
  Id invite you up but the place is being painted
  Oh thats okay
  Unless you want to go to your place
  Okay but theres no cake or anything if thats what youre looking for
  frustrated Take it easy Huh Take it easy
  I think if ones going to kill oneself the least you could do is leave a note Its common courtesy I dont know Thats just the way I was brought up
  Values are very important
  Oh so important So what are you doing uh Thursday night You wanna have dinner
  Thursdays great
  Tan pants Why do I buy tan pants Donna I dont feel comfortable in them
  Are those Cotton Dockers
  Oh I cant begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial
  Really I like that commercial
  You like that commercial
  Yeah its clever
  Now wait a second you mean the one where the guys are all standing around supposedly being very casual and witty
  Yeah thats the one
  What could you possibly like about that
  I dont know I like the guys
  Yeah theyre so funny and so comfortable with each other and I could be comfortable too if I had pants like that I could sit on a porch and wrestle around and maybe even be part of a real bull session
  Hey I know guys like that To me the dialogue rings true
  Even if the dialogue did ring true Donna starts to get annoyed that Jerry wont let the conversation go Even if somehow somewhere men actually talk like that what does that have to do with the pants Doesnt that bother you
  annoyed Thats the idea Thats whats clever about it that theyre not talking about the pants
  But theyre talking about nothing
  Thats the point
  I know the point
  No one is telling you to like it
  I mean all those quick shots of the pants Just pants pants pants pants pants pants pants What is that supposed to be
  Whats brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other through Because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future you have to magnify everything about them You know like the guyll be like I dont think her eyebrows are even Could I look at uneven eyebrows for the rest of my life And of course the womans looking at the guy thinking What is he looking at Do I want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my life
  Im supposed to see her again on Thursday but can I go out with someone who actually likes this commercial
  I once broke up with a guy because he didnt keep his bathroom clean enough
  No kidding Did you tell him that was the reason
  Oh yeah I told him all the time You would not have believed his tub Germs were building a town in there  they were constructing offices Houses near the drain were going for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars
  Hi
  Youre still thinking about this
  She invites me up at twelve oclock at night for coffee and I dont go up No thank you I dont want coffee It keeps me up Too late for me to drink coffee I said this to her People this stupid shouldnt be allowed to live I cant imagine what she must think of me
  She thinks youre a guy that doesnt like coffee
  She invited me up Coffees not coffee coffee is sex
  Maybe coffee was coffee
  Coffees coffee in the morning Its not coffee at twelve oclock at night
  Well some people drink coffee that late
  Yeah people who work at NORAD whore on twentyfour hour missile watch Everything was going along so great She was laughing I was funny I kept saying to myself Keep it up dont blow it youre doing great
  Its all in your head All she knows is she had a good time I think you should call her
  I cant call her now Its too soon Im planning a Wednesday call
  Oh why I love it when guys call me the next day
  Of course you do but youre imagining a guy you like not a guy who goes Oh no I dont drink coffee late at night If I call her now shes gonna think Im too needy Women dont wanna see need They want a takecharge guy  a colonel a Kaiser a tsar
  All shell think is that you like her
  Thats exactly what Im trying to avoid
  Well she wants you to like her
  Yes she wants me to like her if she likes me But she doesnt like me
  I dont know what your parents did to you
  Hey I just thought of a really funny thing for your act All right youre up there youre on the stage and you go Hey you ever notice how cars here in New York they never get out of the way of ambulances anymore Someones in a lifeanddeath situation and were thinking Well sorry buddy you shouldve thought of that when you were eating cheese omelettes and sauages for breakfast every morning for the last thirty years
  So you gonna use it
  I dont think so
  Its funny
  It is funny
  I like to use my own material

  Well I painted my apartment again Ive been living in this apartment for years and years and every time I paint it it kinda gets me down I look around and I think well its a little bit smaller now You know I realize its just the thickness of the paint but Im aware of it It just coming in and coming in Everytime I paint it its closer and closer I dont even know where the wall outlets are anymore I just look for like a lump with two slots in it Kinda looks like a pig is trying to push his way through from the other side Thats where I plug in My idea of the perfect living room would be the bridge on the Starship Enterprise You know what I mean Big chair nice screen remote control Thats why Star Trek really was the ultimate male fantasy Just hurtling through space in your living room watching TV Thats why all the aliens were always dropping in because Kirk was the only one that had the big screen They came over Friday nights Klingon boxing gotta be there
  What did you do
  Mousse I moussed up
  I guess it was just a matter of time
  You know I shouldve done this years ago I mean I feel like Ive had two lives My premousse And now I begin my postmousse Hey tell me the truth have you ever seen a better looking guy
  Well looks are so subjective

  I was only joking to Jerry He thinks Im gonna give you Mrs Hudwalkers things
  in Spanish You offered them to him
  to Jerry We have to go up there now and clean the apartment Its a good thing her rent was overdue Shed be rotting up there for a month
  She died Mrs Hudwalker died
  Ninetyfour years old I found her yesterday She didnt have her wig on It was horrifying

  Are you kidding You know my friend Elaine
  Oh yeah I like her She always says hello to me
  Its not promised to anybody Cause shed take it in a second
  Well Manny wanted it for his brother but he got deported

  Whats the difference Its true
  So its okay I could just tell her she can have it
  Sure sure Shes getting a bargain too Its only four hundred dollars a month
  in Spanish Four hundred dollars What are you nuts Someone will pay more
  Okay
  Okay

  not understanding him Hey thanks
  What was that all about
  coyly Oh nothing important
  Whats going on What is that look
  What look Nothing
  Somethings going on here
  I dont know if you should sit for this or not Sitting is good if you faint but standing is good for jumping up and down I cant decide
  Jumping up and down What are you talking about Cmon Cough it up
  Oh Elaine You know the way I am  rarely ever thinking of myself My only concern is the welfare and happiness of those close to me Sure it hurts sometimes to give and give and give

  Oh were neighbors Ill be here all the time
  All the time
  overly excited We can exchange keys so we can come in and out Oh this is going to be great

  The problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing I think life would be a lot better if it was like youre always making a movie You mess up somebody just walks on the set and stops the whole shot You know what I mean Think of the things you wish you could take back Youre out somewhere with people Gee you look pregnant are you Cut cut cut cut cut thats not gonna work at all Walk out the door and come back in Lets take this whole scene again People think about what youre saying
  Thanks see you later Donna
  What happened to you
  You cant believe what I just did
  What What did you do
  I could tell you what I did but you wouldnt believe it Its not believable
  What did you do
  How could I have done that
  Done what
  I told Elaine about an apartment opening up in my building Shes going to move in
  Elaines moving into your building
  Yes Right above me
  Right above you
  Yeah
  Youre gonna be neighbors
  I know Neighbors
  Shes right above you
  Right above me
  How could you do that
  Cause Im an idiot You may think youre an idiot but with all due respect Im a much bigger idiot than you are
  Dont insult me my friend Remember who youre talking to No ones a bigger idiot than me
  Did you ever ask an exgirlfriend to move into your building
  Did you ever go to a singles weekend in the Poconos
  Shes right in my building Right above me Every time I come in the building Im gonna have to sneak around like a cat burglar
  Youre doomed Youre gonna have to have all your sex at womens apartments Itll be like a permanent road trip Forget about the home bed advantage
  But I need the home bed advantage
  Of course We all do
  Come in for two minutes and sit with me
  I was just in there Its embarrassing
  Oh whos gonna know
  They saw me walk out
  Two minutes
  My censoring system broke down You know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say Makes sure you dont make a mistake He went for a cup of coffee And in that second ruined my life
  My censor quit two years ago He checked into a clinic Emotionally exhausted
  So is there any way out of this Elaine thing
  Tough
  You know the water pressures terrible in my building And she loves a good shower
  I never heard of anyone would turned down an apartment because of a weak shower spray
  If they were fanatic about showers they might
  For that rent shed take a bath in the toilet tank if she had to
  Look at that woman feeding her baby greasy disgusting coffee shop corned beef hash Isnt that child abuse
  Id like to have a kid Of course you have to have a date first Remember my friend Adam from Detroit
  Yeah the guy with the flat head
  Hes a cube Anyway he got married six months ago He told me ever since hes been wearing a wedding band women have been coming on to him everywhere he goes
  Yeah Ive heard that about wedding bands
  I wonder if thats really true
  That would be an interesting sociological experiment You know Kramer has his fathers band Hed loan it to you
  Thanks a lot Ill give it back to you in a week
  You know I dont even know why youre fooling around with this ring Ive been telling you get yourself some plugs Or a piece
  Im not doing that
  Oh man You know youre crazy Youre a good looking guy What do you want to walk around like that for
  No Ill put half a can of mousse in my head like you
  I told you I dont like these sponges theyre too small I want a big sponge
  You cant pick up anything with these Theres no absorption
  Boys boys
  Hi Jerry
  Hello Jerry in spanish to Harold You tell him
  Okay
  in spanish to Harold again You tell him
  Your friend cant have the apartment Jerry
  What
  Because somebody offered Manny five thousand dollars for the apartment I dont want to do it Manny wants to do it
  in spanish Why are you telling him its my fault
  Because its true Why shouldnt I tell him
  Hey hey I understand Youre businessmen
  in spanish Tell him that if his friend can come up with the same money then she can have the apartment
  Oh now he says that if your friend has five thousand dollars well give it to her
  Well thats a lot of money But if thats the way its gotta be thats the way its gotta be
  You know I used to think that the universe is a random chaotic sequence of meaningless events but I see now that there is reason and purpose to all things
  What happened to you
  Religion my friend thats what happened to me Because I have just been informed that its going to cost Elaine the sum of five thousand dollars to get the apartment upstairs
  jubilant Five thousand dollars She doesnt have five thousand dollars
  Of course she doesnt have five thousand dollars
  So she cant get the apartment
  Cant get it
  So she doesnt move in
  No move So you see its all part of a divine plan
  And how does the baldness fit into that plan
  to the intercom Elaine
  Yeah
  to George All right this is going to require some great acting now I have to pretend Im disappointed Youre going to really see me being a phony now I hope you can take this Maybe you should go in the other room
  Are you kidding I lie every second of the day My whole life is a sham
  Cause you know I love Elaine
  Of course you do
  But you know not in the building Really I feel terrible about this My intentions were good What can I do Tell me
  to someone in the hallway No Ill be seeing you She enters the apartment singing Good morning good morning to Jerry and George Have you ever gotten up in the morning and felt its great to be alive That every breath is a gift of sweet life from above
  Oh and before I forget I have the checks for the first month last months security deposit laughs I have seventyfive dollars left in my account
  Well theres a little bit of a problem
  Oh I know Theres a weak shower spray I know Ive already thought about it and Im switching to baths As Winston Churchill said Why stand when you can sit Maybe Ill get some rubber duckies
  Uh no uh someone offered Harold and Manny five thousand for the apartment Im sure theyd just as soon give it to you but youd have to come up with that money
  Five thousand dollars I dont have five thousand dollars
  I know
  disappointed How am I going to get five thousand dollars
  I have no idea
  to Elaine Hey my new neighbor
  Im not moving in
  What

  So okay uh whats the problem
  I dont have five thousand dollars
  Cmon you can come up with five thousand dollars to Jerry Jerry you dont have five thousand dollars you can led her Come on

  Hey everybody Here come the runners
  to Jerry So you and Roxanne are hitting it off huh
  Oh I wouldnt quite say that
  Really From a distance you seemed to be coming on to her
  Im a guy  it always looks like that
  Because I was thinking are you at all concerned that living in the same building will yknow cramp our styles
  Nah
  Because I was worried that there might be a situation in which one of us come home with somebody it could get a little uncomfortable But as long as youre okay with it its fine with me
  Ive never been able to be with just one person I can however carry on strictly physical relationships which can last for years and years Its a shame youre married
  Umm Im not Its just a sociological experiment
  Please
  You have no idea what an idiot is Elaine just gave me a chance to get out and I didnt take it pointing to himself This is an idiot
  Is that right I just threw away a lifetime of guiltfree sex and floor seats for ever sporting event in Madison Square Garden So please a little respect For I am Costanza Lord of the Idiots

  Oh I love the one they do right after this one Starts dancing
  I dont know What do you do when a neighbor is making like a lot of noise at three oclock in the morning I mean can you knock on someones door and tell them to keep it down Youre really altering your whole selfimage I mean what am I Fred Mertz now Whats happening to me Can I do this Am I a shusher I used to be a shushee Theres a lot of shushing going on in movie theaters People are always shushing Shh shh shhh shhh Doesnt work cause nobody knows where a shush is coming from They just hear a shh Was that a shush I think somebody just shushed me Some people you cant shush in a movie theater Theres always that certain group of people isnt it Theyre talking and talking and everyone around them is shushing them and shushing them They wont shush Theyre the unshushables
  I have to tell you that I did some very exciting news recently and I dont know if I should really tell you exactly what it is because its really not a definite thing yet crowd cheers him on to tell them Well I will tell you what I know so far According to the information that I have in the envelope that Ive received it seems that I may have already won some very valuable prizes audience applauds Well thank you thank you very much well thank you Thats very nice to hear that But in all honesty I have to say I didnt even know I was in this thing But according to the readout it looks like I am among the top people that they are considering You know thats what annoys me about the sweepstakes companies they always tease you with that You may have already won Id like once for a sweepstakes company to have some guts come out with the truth just tell people the truth one time Send out envelopes You have definitely lost You turn it over giant printing Not even close You open it up theres this whole letter of explanation Even we cannot believe how badly you have done in this contest
  to Kramer To the right
  That took awhile
  Dont get up
  Id like to help but my neck
  So how long has it been in the basement
  Since my grandfather died I was suppose to send it down to my parents in Florida but they didnt want it They told me to get rid of it but I felt funny and then I sort of forgot about it And its been sitting down there for three years until he saw it to Kramer All right so just take what you want and lets get it out of here
  Whats in it
  Grandpa clothes I cant wear em

  Cant you talk to your boss
  I did He loves Rava Worse he loves Ray And he didnt think youre funny at all

  Angry Yeah thats what they told me the last time

  Women go after doctors like men go after models They want someone with knowledge of the body we just want the body

  Trying to shut him up Kramer
  The really bad thing about the heart is the sex thing See you gotta be careful about sex now You get that heart pumping and suddenly boom Next thing you know you got a hose coming out of your chest attached to a piece of luggage
  Kramer George didnt have a heart attack

  No no hes out He got out See the medical establishment see they tried to frame him Its all politics But hes a rebel
  A rebel No Johnny Yuma was a rebel Eckman is a nut George you want to take care of your tonsils you do it in a hospital With a doctor
  Hes holistic George Hes holistic
  Holistic that sounds right
  George you need a medical doctor
  To Jerry Let me ask you something How much do you think it would cost to have tonsils and adenoids removed in the hospital
  Well an overnight stay in a hospital Minor surgery I dunno four grand

  Oh yeah Holistic thats what I need Thats the answer
  Healers apartment
  So how do you like the way I talked you into comin down here
  Dont flatter yourself my friend Im here strictly for material and I have a feeling this is a potential gold mine I still think youre nuts though
  All I know is Ive been going to doctors all my life What has it gotten me Im thirtythree years old I havent outgrown the problems of puberty Im already facing the problems of old age I completely skipped healthy adulthood I went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever You could do your taxes in the time it takes me to have an orgasm Ive never had a normal medium orgasm
  Jokingly making fun of George Ive never had a really good pickle
  Besides whats it gonna cost me Thirtyeight bucks
  To Jerry Would you not put your foot on that please
  Sorry
  What month were you born
  April
  You should have been born in August Your parents would have been welladvised to wait
  Really
  Do you use hot water in the shower
  Yes
  Stop using it
  Okay
  Im off hot water
  Kramer tells me that you are interested in an alternative to surgery
  Yes yes I am
  Blows into Georges face I think we can help you See unfortunately the medical establishment is a business like any other business And business needs customers And they want to sell you their most expensive item which is unnecessary surgery
  Still on the showers Can I use hot water on my face
  No You know I am not a business man Im a holistic healer Its a calling its a gift You see its in the best interest of the medical profession that you remain sick You see that insures good business Youre not a patient Youre a customer
  He thinks this the audience can hear his thoughts And youre not a doctor but you play one in real life
  Still on the hot water What about shaving
  To Jerry Youre eating too much dairy To George May I Reaches over and touches Georges face
  I guess so
  Feeling Georges face You see you are in disharmony The throat is the gateway to the lung Tonsillitis adenoiditis is in Chinese medical terms and invasion of heat and wind
  Again we hear his thoughts Theres some hot air blowing in here
  You know I lived with the Eskimos many years ago and they used to plunge their faces into the snow
  Once again still on the shower Could it be lukewarm
  Too much dairy You really think Im eating too much dairy
  Doctors car
  The tongue yes the tongue or in medical terms the glossa Its a muscular organ Consists of two parts the body and the root You see its covered by this mucous membrane These little raised projections are the papillae which give it that furry appearance Very tactile

  Shut up
  Aaahhhgggg
  Night club
  I have a friend whos a hypochondriac always thinks hes sick  never is And they you have another type of person always thinks theyre well not matter how bad they really are You know this type of person Very annoying Feel great like being on the respirator intravenous heartlung machine I never felt better in my life Medical science is making advances every day in control health problems In fact its probably only a matter of time before a heart attack you know becomes like a head ache Well just see people on TV going I had a heart attack this big Holds out hands gesturing bigness but I gave myself one of these Clear Puts imaginary electrode panels to his chest Brrhht and its gone
  What are you doing All right all right Whats the matter with that What about that one
  Robert Vaughn The Helsinki Formula
  He was good in Man From Uncle
  Guess whose birthdays comin up soon
  I know Im having my root canal the same week
  Oh right I hope you have a good oral surgeon because that can be very serious Changes channel Hey look at naked people
  No I dont wanna see the naked people
  Been a while
  I have a vague recollection of doing something with someone but it was a long long time ago
  I think my last time was in Rochester My hair was a lot shorter
  I remember that its a good thing Someday I hope to do it again Jerry looks at Elaine
  What
  What
  What was that look
  What look
  The look you just gave me
  I gave a look
  Yes
  What kind of look
  I know that look
  Then what was it
  Why should I tell you
  Well youre the big look expert I wanna see how smart you are
  Trust me I know the look Pause So
  What
  What about the look
  I dont know
  You got something on your mind
  No Things pop into your head You
  Things occur to me from time to time
  Yeah me too Well you cant expect to just forget the past completely
  No of course not
  I mean it was something we did Probably about what Twentyfive times
  Thirtyseven
  Yeah we pretty much know what were doin in there Points to bedroom
  We know the terrain
  No big surprises
  Nope
  What do you think
  I dont know What do you think
  Well its something to consider
  Yeah
  I mean lets say we did
  What if
  Is that like the end of the world or something
  Certainly not
  Why shouldnt we be able to do that once in a while if we want to
  I know
  I mean really what is the big deal We go in there Points to the bedroom Were in there for a while We come right back out here Its not complicated
  Its almost stupid if we didnt
  Its moronic
  Absurd
  Of course I guess maybe some little problems could arise
  We there are always a few
  I mean if anything happened and we couldnt be friends the way we are now that would be really bad
  Devastating
  Because this is very good Points back and forth between them to indicate friendship
  And that would be good Points to bedroom
  That would be good too The idea is combine the this and the that But this cannot be disturbed
  Yeah we just wanna take this and add that
  But of course wed have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems Maybe some rules or something
  Huh
  For example now I call you whenever Im inclined and vice versa
  Right
  But if we did that we might feel a certain obligation to call
  Well why should that be Oh I have an idea I have an idea No call the day after that
  Beautiful Lets make it a rule
  All right sir
  Now heres another little rule
  Yeah
  When we see each other now we retire to our separate quarters But sometimes when people get involved with that they feel pressure to sleep over When that is not really sleep Sleep is separate from that And I dont see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that
  Okay okay Rule Number Two Spending the night is optional
  Well now were gettin somewhere
  What about the kiss goodnight
  Tough one Youre call
  Its brugwa 
  Fine Well
  Well
  You ready
  Ready
  So think you can handle this
  Definitely Runs into bookshelf
  Hey
  Hey
  Got the paper
  Not yet
  No paper
  I havent been out yet
  Well whats taking you so long Elaine enters from the bedroom Kramer is a little shocked Uh Oh well yeah He exits
  Whats the deal with Aquaman Could he go on land or was he just restricted to water
  No I think I saw him on land a couple times So hows the job situation goin
  Still lookin Its pretty bad out there What about you
  Nothin much I slept with Elaine last night
  Oxygen I need some oxygen This is major
  I thought youd like that
  Oh this is huge
  I know
  All right okay Lets go details
  No I cant do details
  You wha
  I cant give details
  No details
  Im not in the mood
  You ask me here to have lunch tell me you slept with Elaine and then say youre not in the mood for details Now you listen to me I want details and I want them right now I dont have a job I have no place to go Youre not in the mood Well you get in the mood
  All right okay Were in the apartment watching TV
  Where are you sitting
  On the couch
  Next to each other
  No separated
  Time
  Around eleven
  Okay go ahead
  So shes flipping around the TV and she gets to the naked station
  Oh see thats why I dont have cable in my house Because of that naked station If I had that in my house I would never turn it off I wouldnt sleep I wouldnt eat Eventually firemen would have to break through the door theyd find me sitting there in my pajamas with drool coming down my face All right all right So youre watching the naked station
  And then somehow we started talking about what if we had sex
  Boy these are really bad details
  It pains me to say this but I may be getting to mature for details
  Oh I hate to hear this That kind of growth really irritates me
  Well Ill tell you though It was really passionate
  Better than before
  She mustve taken some kind of seminar or something
  This is all too much So what are you feeling Whats going on Are you like a couple again now
  Not exactly
  Not exactly What does that mean
  Well weve tried to arrange a situation where well be able to do this once in a while and still be friends George laughs hysterically and stands out of his seat
  Where are you living Are you here Are you on this planet Its impossible It cant be done
  I think weve worked out a system
  Oh you know what youre like Youre like a pathetic gambler Youre one of those losers in Las Vegas who keeps thinking hes gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack
  No this is very advanced Weve designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by avoiding all of the relationship pitfalls
  Sure all right Tell me the rules
  Okay No calls the next day
  To himself So youre havin the sex next day you dont have to call Thats pretty good Back to Jerry Go ahead
  You ready for the second one
  I have tell you Im pretty impressed with the first one
  Spending the night Optional
  No you see You got greedy
  No thats the rule Its optional
  I know less about women than anyone in the world But one thing I do know is theyre not happy if you dont spend the night It could be a hot sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide Displays with French fry Youre not going anywhere
  I think youre wrong
  I hope I am
  Is this yours or the roommates
  The roommates
  Would she mind
  She keeps track of everything
  Well thats too bad cause Im takin it
  Thanks
  Well guess Ill get going
  Oh

  Fine go away
  I dont understand Is there a problem Elaine is pulling a roll of paper towels about twenty feet long Im getting the impression theres a problem
  Just go
  Im having surgery tomorrow
  Oh surgery Youre going to the dentist
  But you said it can be very serious
  Okay so fine Go
  What happened to the rules Remember Sleeping over was optional

  What am I supposed to get a bazooka
  You dont understand Im in a very delicate position Whatever I give her shes going to be bringing in experts from all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it
  What does she need Maybe theres something that she needs
  I think I heard her say something about a bench
  A bench What kind of a bench

  Like a park bench
  I have no idea
  Who puts a bench in their house

  Those birthdays I told you Theyre relationship killers If a relationship is having any problems whatsoever a birthday will always bring it out
  I never should have made up those rules
  What is it about sex that just disrupts everything Is it the touching Is it the nudity
  It cant be the nudity I never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when I was changing before gym class
  You know what this means I cant see her anymore either
  Why
  Its break up by association Besides shes mad at me anyway because of my birthday present
  What did you end up giving her
  91 dollars
  Sorry about that
  So whatre you gonna do
  Well if I call her theres no joking around anymore This is pretty much it
  So maybe this should be it
  Could be it
  She seems like an it
  Shes at it as you get Imagine bumping into her on the street in five years with a husband And she tells me hes a sculptor they live in Vermont
  Wed have to kill him
  Wed get caught Id get the chair
  Id go to prison as your accomplice Id have to wear that really heavy denim Go to the cafeteria line with the guy who slops those mashed potatoes onto your plate Go to the bathroom in front of hundreds of people

  So what happened with Tatiana
  I shouldnt even tell you this
  Come on
  Well after dinner last week she invites me back to her apartment
  Im with you
  Well its this little place with this little bathroom Its like right there you know its not even down a little hall or off in an alcove You understand Theres no buffer zone So we start to fool around and its the first time and its early in the going And I begin to perceive this impending intestinal requirement whose needs are going to surpass by great lengths anything in the sexual realm So I know Im gonna have to stop And as this is happening Im thinking even if I can somehow manage to momentarily extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force I know that that bathroom is not gonna provide me with the privacy that I know Im going to need
  This could only happen to you
  So I finally stop and say Tatiana I hope you dont take this the wrong way but I think it would be best if I left
  You said this to her after
  No During
  Oh boy
  Yeah
  Wow So
  So Im dressing and shes staring up at me struggling to compute this unprecedented turn of events I dont know what to say to reassure this woman and worst of all I dont have the time to say it The only excuse she might possibly have accepted is if I told her I am in reality Batman and Im very sorry I just saw the BatSignal It took me 3 days of phone calls to get her to agree to see me again Now shes waiting for me to call her and shes
  I hate this place I dont know why we came here Im never coming back here again
  Who is that woman
  Remember when you first went out to eat with your parents Remember it was such a treat to go and they serve you this different food that you never saw before and they put it in front of you and it is such a delicious and exciting adventure And now I just feel like a big sweaty hog waiting for them to fill up the trough

  Thats a tough minute Its like waiting in the shower for the conditioner to work
  I dont understand why he couldnt take a cab
  Who
  Elaine is having a houseguest Shes picking him up at the airport tonight
  A guy
  Slightly embarrassed Yes a guy
  Hes from a Yakima right
  Seattle
  Everybodys moving to Seattle
  Its the pesto of cities So
  To Jerry You tell him
  Well from what I can piece together our friend here met a gentleman
  Ed
  Who was in town on a business venture and um
  We shared an interpersonal experience George hits his glass with his fork To Jerry Go on
  So they went out a few times but apparently when the fellow returned home he discovered that the Benes tattoo does not wash off so easily
  On some people
  Oooh
  So hes coming in to stay with her for a week
  It was just gonna be a weekend but then somehow it became a week
  What happened
  Oh the busboy left the menu a little close to the candle
  Sorry to the disturbance
  Joking she snobbishly says Im never eating here again
  Pats George on the back Nice going Thank you that ought to get us a free dessert They can see the manager chewing the busboy out from the dining room doorway I think the busboys in trouble
  Did I get him in trouble Because of what I said I just told him what happened he didnt do it on purpose Mangager and busboy are arguing The busboy points in the direction of George He pointed at me Why did he point at me
  I said I would never eat here again But I I he had to know I was kidding
  Casually buttering a roll like hes the innocent one I didnt say anything
  I cant believe it Hes going Hes fired
  Oh I said it in a kidding way
  I didnt know hed get fired
  Jokingly trying to put more pressure on Elaine and George Hell probably kill his family over this
  What if hes waiting for me outside He pointed at me Did you see him point
  Again joking A lot of excons become busboys They seem to gravitate twards em
  Was it my fault
  Was it my fault
  Doesnt have a care in the world Maybe Ill try that pesto
  Jerrys apartment
  Look I feel bad for him too but hell get another job I mean lets face it its not a profession where you embellish your resume and undergo a series of grueling interviews
  Eating a sandwich Oh like you really know busboys

  Slow as if remember a dream I never new I could drive like that I was going faster than Ive ever gone before and yet it all seemed to be happening in slow motion I was seeing three and four moves ahead weaving in and out of lanes like an Olympic skier on a gold metal run I knew I was challenging the very laws of physics At Queens Boulevard I took the shoulder At Jewel Avenue I used the median I had it I was there and then I hit the Van Wyck They say no ones ever beaten the Van Wyck but gentlemen I tell you this  I came as close as anyone ever has And if it hadnt been for that fivecarpileup on Rockaway Boulevard that numbskull would be on a plane for Seattle right now instead of looking for a parking space downstairs
  The busboys coming The busboys coming

  Hes coming up Moves to the door Ill check you out later

  Antonio In here
  Nervous his voice cracks Hey Antonio Hows it going

  Trying to be modest Ah come on
  Into the intercom Yeah
  Its Eddie
  Hes coming up Buzzes him in Hes coming up
  And that very same night of the accident while looking for Pequita I found a job in a restaurant where they pay me almost twice what I was making before  and when I returned to the apartment Pequita perhaps frightened from the explosion had miraculously returned Well but now I must go for today I am starting my new and wonderful job And I am very late Thank you thank you thank you all Leaves

  Oh that was awful Poor Antonio Waiter hands Elaine two bags of food to go Thanks
  So much longer
  Till when  till he goes back to Seattle or till he can feed himself
  Not wanting to make Elaine mad I guess its not important
  Take care of yourselves Leaves
  I should probably get going too If I dont feed Pequita by seven she goes all over everything take it easy
  Yeah Takes a bite of his sandwich as the waiter starts cleaning off the table How ya doing
  Night club
  First of all I cant believe that people actually do fight People have fist fights in life I cant really believe that we have boxing either Its really kind of an amazing thing To me the problem with boxing is  you have two guys having a fight that have no prior argument Why dont they have the boxers come into the ring in little cars drive around a bit have a little accident They get out Didnt you see my signal Look at that fender Then youd see a real fight
  EvryEvery time somebody recommends a doctor hes always the best Oh is he good Oh hes the best This guys the best They cant all be the best There cant be this many bests Someones graduating at the bottom of these classes where are these doctors Is somewhere someone saying to their friend You should see my doctor hes the worst Oh yeah hes the worst hes the absolute worst there is Whatever youve got itll be worse after you see him No hes just hes a butcher The mans a butcher And then theres always that Make sure that you tell him that you know you know me Why Whats the difference Hes a doctor What is it Oh you know Bob Okay Ill give you the real medicine And everybody else Im giving TicTacs
  And usually for lunch Ill have a salad and for dinner I eat whatever I want
  What do you think the worst part of being blind is
  Excuse me
  You know if you were blind what do you think the worst part of it would be
  I dont know
  I think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food How could you ever enjoy a meal like that Id constantly be feeling around with my lips and my tongue
  Well thats how my fiveyear old eats Hes a very picky eater
  You hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in Pennsylvania
  No
  He was at a carnival with his mother She goes to get a hot dog next thing you know she turns around boom hes gone
  Oh
  Imagine how sick a person has to be to do something like that she starts the quick hand chops on his back And these people are all over the place You never know whos crazy I could be one of these people
  Have you seen any good movies
  Who takes care of your boy during the day
  We have a woman Why
  No no Im just saying
  She had references
  Oh Im sure she did Im sure theyre impeccable Im talking about the ones that forge em
  about the massageYou know I think this is really helping
  I dont live near here ya know
  So shes giving me the massage and Im just making conversation
  I dont like to talk during a massage
  Neither do I but I do it for them I figure theyre bored
  Yeah I do that too I feel guilty about getting the pleasure I feel like I dont deserve it so I talk It stops me from enjoying it Theres nothing to eat in here
  Oh I forgot to tell you
  Im in the middle of a story
  Oh okay go ahead
  Why dont you ever go shopping
  Well its not like its a really funny story or anything
  What happened
  Well so she mentioned that she had a son and then for some reason I launch into the story about the kid from Pennsylvania who was abducted
  Oh wasnt that terrible
  Yes it was
  Not even an apple
  She doesnt want to hear that that was stupid
  I know it was stupid
  Really stupid she takes a big sip from her bottled water
  Hey I just said it was stupid
  What about this leftover Chinese food
  Take it
  I cant believe you said that
  Hey would you stop it already
  So whatd she say
  I dont know she actually seemed to get a little paranoid
  he just took a bite of the Chinese food  This is terrible What is this ginger I hate ginger I cant understand how anyone can eat ginger puts the container back in the refrigerator
  I have a good masseuse you could go to
  Nah shes really good and shes not just a masseuse shes a physical therapist Theres a big difference She uses the ultrasound its a real medical procedure In fact if you get a doctors note its covered by insurance
  Physical therapy is covered by insurance
  Yeah
  You dont have to pay for the massage
  Not if you have a doctors note
  So where do you get this note
  Well Ive never actually done it but if I really wanted to I could probably get one from my friend Roy the dentist

  And you dont have to pay

  Wait wait hold on now wait wait bang he slams his hand down on the table startling Jerry Elaine and George bang again yip another high pitched yelping sound yip yip See I told you
  What causes homophobia What is it that makes a heterosexual man worry I think its because men know that deep down we have weak sales resistance Were constantly buying shoes that hurt us pants that dont fit right Men think Obviously I can be talked into anything What if I accidentally wander into some sort of homosexual store thinking its a shoe store and the salesman goes Just hold this guys hand walk around the store a little bit see how you feel No obligation no pressure just try it Would you like to see him in a sandal

  Well what happened Was she there
  No no she wasnt
  You didnt get my papers

  Well where is she
  A mental institution
  Why is it so difficult uncomfortable to be naked Its because when you have clothes on you can always kinda make those little adjustments which people like to do  you feel like youre getting it together yeah yeah pretty good pulling at lapels pockets etc feeling good looking good But when youre naked its like its so final youre Well thats it no movements Theres nothing else I can do Thats why I like to wear a belt when Im naked Cause I feel it gives me something I know Im naked but you know tugging and lifting belt I like to get pockets to hang off of the belt that would be wouldnt that be the ultimate To be naked and still be able to do this hand in pocket I think that would really help a lot
  A mental institution
  You know what they do in there Did you see CooCoos Nest They put those electrodes in your head
  Its not really a mental institution Its more like a depression clinic She went out to Woodhaven and checked herself in Im Im sick over this
  Who told you this
  Her roommate Ive driven women to lesbianism before but never to a mental institution
  My friend Bob Sacamano had shock treatments But his synapses were so large it had no effect
  You know I hate to raise a crass financial concern but was there any information as to the where abouts of my PAPERS
  She put them in her pocket book She probably took them out there with her
  So what now
  I dont know
  Can we go out there
  Where
  Woodhaven
  We could
  Im very nervous about this Ive never spoken to a mental patient before
  My cousin Douglas was in a place like this one time  He came over to my house for dinner There was no soda and he went bezerk He was screamin wheres the Pepsi wheres the Pepsi

  I was audited last year At first I thought well IRS kinda sounds like Toys R Us maybe wont be so bad Maybe they have a sense of fun about it you know But its its bad Its an ordeal And they dont do anything to keep your spirits up through the ordeal I think they should take all your receipts and put them in one of those big Lucite sweepstake drums and just kinda crank it around there You know give me a feeling like you might win something You know what I mean Then they can pull them out one by one and go Oh Im sorry thats another illegal deduction But we do have some lovely parting gifts for you Jail

  Ellen We uh broke up again
  Awwwwww
  Too bad
  I thought she was the one
  Ill bring back the pot
  Okay cmon its movie time
  Hey what are you gonna see
  Prognosis Negative
  Hey thats supposed to be great
  Its not
  How do you know
  I have an instinct for these things
  I had a parakeet when I was a kid that was the only pet that I really enjoyed We used to let him out of his cage and he would fly around and my mother had built one entire wall of our living room was mirrored She felt this gives you a feeling of space Have you ever heard this interior design principle that a mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room What kind of a jerk walks up to a mirror and goes Hey look theres a whole nother room in there Theres a guy in there looks just like me But the parakeet will fall for this youll let him out of his cage he flies around the room BANG With his little head he would just go click Ohh And Id always think even if he thinks the mirror is another room why doesnt he at least try to avoid hitting the other parakeet
  Does it seem to you that the ventriloquist dummy has a very active sexual social life hes always talking about dates and women that he knows and bringing them back to the suitcase at night theres always a sawdust joke in there somewhere you know kinky things cuz hes made out of wood an he can spin his head around were somehow expected to believe because the face is soo animated that they think we arent noticing that the feet are just swinging there dummy feet never look right do they theyre just kinda dangling there always kinda askew you know you always see just little ankle those thin fabric ankles that they have you know Ya think I dont think this thing is real
  Let me speak with the head librarian  Because its absurd An overdue book from 1971  This is a joke right What are you From a radio station
  enters
  Ya got me I fell for it Alright OK I can be down there in like a half hour Bye
  Whats the problem
  This youre not goin to believe The NYPL says that I took out Tropic of Cancer in 1971 and never returned it
  Do you know how much that comes to Thats a nickel a day for 20 years Its going to be 50000
  It doesnt work like that
  If its a dime a day it could be 100000
  Its not going to be anything I returned the book I remember it very vividly because I was with Sherry Becker She wore this orange dress It was the first time I ever saw her in a dress like that In oticed since ninth grade she was developing this body in secret under these loose clothes for like two years And then one day 
  That orange dress is burned in my memory
  Oh memory burn
  I wonder what ever happened to her
  How did they ever find you
  Oh computers theyre cracking down now on overdue books The whole thing is completely ridiculous
  Its George Wait til he hears were going to the library
  You know I never got a library card
  to speaker Coming down
  Its all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway People sitting around reading the newspaper attached to huge wooden sticks Trying to save a quarter ooh

  Wheres George
  Shhh
  Tryin to save a quarter
  I kinda like those sticks Id like to get them in my house
  This womans completely ignoring me
  Look at her This is a lonely woman looking for companionship  Spinster  Maybe a virgin  Maybe she got hurt a long time ago She was a schoolgirl There was a boy It didnt work out Now she needs a little tenderness She needs a little understanding She needs a little Kramer
  Eventually a little shot of penicillin
  Yes
  Yeah I called before I got his notice in the mail
  Oh Tropic of Cancer Henry Miller Uh this case has been turned over to our library investigation officer Mr Bookman
  Bookman The library investigators name is actually Bookman

  Hes older completely covered in filth no whistle but I think its him
  George got him fired He squealed on him

  Oh hi Mr Lippman
  Elaine

  So they forgot to get your lunch Big deal
  What do you know Youve never worked in an office TURNS TO GEORGE See George youve worked in an office Jerry thinks Im over reacting but you understand  LUNCH
  I dont understand lunch I dont know anything about lunch Listen Just because I got the guy fired doesnt mean I turned him into a bum  does it
  What did he do
  He purposely mispronounced my name Instead of saying Costanza Hed say Cant stand ja Cant stand ja  He made me smell my own gym socks once
  I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class And the straps were hangin down by his 
  OK OK I never even had him for gym
  I had him for Hygene Remember his teeth It was like from an exhumed corpse
  Little baked beans
  Echh
  Come on tell me what happened
  Well OK As I said the guy had it in for me He actually failed me in gym  ME
   Those spastic shnitzer twins 
  Cant stand ja  Cant stand ja
  Yes Mr Hayman
  Your underwear was stickn out of your shorts during gym class
  Well I guess thats because I wear boxer shorts
  Boxer shorts ha ha Well what brand
  Im not really sure I
  Well lets take a look
  He gave me a wedgie
  He got fired the next day
  Why do they call it a wedgie
  Because the underwear is pulled up from the back and  it wedges in
  They also have an atomic wedgie Now the goal there is to actually get the waistband on top of the head Very rare
  Boys are sick
  Well what do girls do 
  We just tease some one til they develop an eating disorder guy who ruined his life
  I gotta go back to the library and talk to him I gotta find out if IMac226m the guy who ruined his life
  Hey Babaloo you better get home You know this guy Bookman from the library hes waiting for ya
  Whats amazing to me about the library is its a place where you go in you can take out any book you whant they just give it to you and say bring it back when youre done It reminds me of like this pathetic friend that everbody had when they were a little kid who would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just be his friend Thats what the library is A government funded pathetic friend And thats why everybody kinds of bullies the library Ill bring it back on time  Ill bring it back late  Oh what are you going to do Charge me a nickel
  Oh Im glad youre here so we can get this all straightened out Would you like a cup of tea
  You got any coffee
  Coffee
  Yeah Coffee
  No I dont drink coffee
  Yeah you dont drink coffee How about instant coffee
  No I dont have
  You dont have any instant coffee
  Well I dont normally
  Who doesnt have instant coffee
  I dont
  You buy a jar of Folgers Crystals you put it in the cupboard you forget about it Then later on when you need it its there It lasts forever Its freezedried Freezedried Crystals
  Really Ill have to remember that
  You took this book out in 1971
  Yes and I returned it in 1971
  Yeah 71 That was my first year on the job Bad year for libraries Bad year for America Hippies burning library cards Abby Hoffman telling everybody to steal books I dont judge a man by the length of his hair or the kind of music he listens to Rock was never my bag But you put on a pair of shoes when you walk into the New York Public Library fella
  Look Mr Bookman II returned that book I remember it very specifically
  Youre a comedian you make people laugh
  I try
  You think this is all a big joke dont you
  No I dont
  I saw you on TV once I remembered your namefrom my list I looked it up Sure enough it checked out You think because youre a celebrity that somehow the law doesnt apply to you that youre above the law
  Certainly not
  Well let me tell you something funny boy Yknow that little stamp the one that says New York Public Library Well that may not mean anything to you but that means a lot to me One whole hell of a lot Sure go ahead laugh if you want to Ive seen your type before Flashy making the scene flaunting convention Yeah I know what youre thinking Whats this guy making such a big stink about old library books Well let me give you a hint junior Maybe we can live without libraries people like you and me Maybe Sure were too old to change the world but what about that kid sitting down opening a book right now in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of peepees and weewees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers Doesnt HE deserve better Look If you think this is about overdue fines and missing books youd better think again This is about that kids right to read a book without getting his mind warped Or maybe that turns you on Seinfeld maybe thats how yget your kicks You and your goodtime buddies Well I got a flash for ya joyboy Party time is over Ygot seven days Seinfeld That is one week
  Whats wrong
  Its Bookman the library cop
  So I I didnt do anything wrong
  Im supposed to be at work I could get fired I shouldnt have come here

  Come on
  STARTS TO LEAVE TO HIMSELF Kramer
  Ive had this condition since I was eleven Ive been in and out of hospitals my whole life I have no control over it Doctors have told me that when I feel it the best thing to do is just release it Otherwise I could die
  Well youre still not allowed
  Do you hear what Im saying to you Im telling you that if I dont go I could die Die Is it worth dying for
  Thats up to you
  So you dont care if I die
  What I care about is the sanitary condition of the parking facility
  It was life and death
  Uh huh
  Oh Im lying Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger I know its against the law
  I dont know
  Because I could get Uromysitisis poisoning and die Thats whyDo you think I enjoy living like thisthe shame the humiliationYou know I have been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition Unfortunately my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning
  C0NTD Him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place You want to call the Department of Social Services Oh its Saturday Theyre closed today My luck
  You can tell the police all about it
  CALLING OUT Jerry
  Jerry
  Unbelievable Im never gonna get out of here The guy goes to pee he never comes back Its like a science fiction story

  No no Ill be back
  Oh whats the difference Well all be dead eventually
  Does that bother you
  Yeah it bothers me Doesnt it bother you
  Not at all
  See now that bothers me even more than dying bothers me cause its people like you who live to be a hundred and twenty because youre not bothered by it How could it not bother you
  I once saw this thing on TV with people who are terminally ill And they all believed the secret of life is just to live every moment
  Yeah yeah Ive heard that Meanwhile Im here with you in a parking garage what am I supposed to do
  First of all you dont even know technically that I went Thats for starters I mean I couldve been pouring a bottle of water out there You dont know
  I know what you did
  Oh really do you Well it just so happens that I did pour water out I had a bottle of very tepid water and I poured it out And I could see how you made a mistake because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating
  CONTD And you know when you think about it its really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity Thats all it is
  Yeah Im sure
  You know this is not the first time this has happened to me I always carry water because of my condition It dehydrates me Its a vicious cycle
  And now hes gone Im sure hes looking for the car Five minutes thats all I just want to find him
  I cant do it
  But why Why cant you do it
  I cant
  No see thats not a reason you cant You just dont want to
  Thats right
  But why Why dont you want to
  I dont know
  But wouldnt you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out
  1 No I wouldnt
  A NEW TACK All right all right I want to apologize I was frightened I said crazy things I obviously offended you I insulted your intelligence The uromysitisis the water bottleI made it all up and nowIm going to tell you the truth Today my father and mother are celebrating their fiftieth well Im jumping ahead here their fortyseventh wedding anniversary We made arrangements to spend the evening together They are supposed to be in front of my building at sixfifteen

  Wow Whatd you say
  You know Im the one responsible for those crop circles in England

  Not everybody knows what the crop circles are to the newsstand owner Do you know what the crop circles are
  Crop circles Why dont you buy something
  You got something in your teeth there
  What
  Its green
  Oh man its spinach Ive been walking around like this all afternoon
  Did you bump into anybody you knew
  I had a job interview
  Howd it go
  Take a guess
  Well Mr Costanza we have nothing available at the present time but should anything open up well be in touch
  Ok thanks
  What do you need a job you got Audrey
  Yeah right
  Whats the matter
  Oh nothing
  What
  You wont think Im a bad person
  Too late for that
  Cause believe me I would only say this to you and maybe a psychiatrist maybe Well her nose is a little big
  Yeah shes got a big nose
  I mean big would even be ok a little beyond big
  Its a schnoz
  Now Im aware that my own physical dimensions are perhaps a little short of perfection
  A little
  So who am I to be thinking about someones nose I mean I should be grateful someone like her even looks at me I have no job nothing But I have to say I think about the nose I dont want to think about the nose I dont ask to think about the nose but I think about it I go to bed at night I tell myself Dont think about the nose forget the nose but I think about it I look at her I see nose
  Stop being so concerned with looks
  Have you said anything to her about it
  I could never do that You know the ironic thing is if she had a smaller nose I never could have gone out with her in the first place Shed be out of my league with a smaller nose And I really like her I know that And I know one other thing Im not getting past that nose
  Alright shut up here they come
  waving How can I not think about it Look at the size of this thing
  So my mothers going out with this guy who leaves a jacket in her house so you know she gives it to me Well two years later he shows up and he takes it back And now hes in prison He got arrested for mail fraud So Elaine all you have to do is go over to the apartment tell the landlord that youre his daughter and you want to bring him the jacket in prison
  Wont the landlord know Im not the daughter
  No no hes never met her Shes in California
  Are you coming with me
  Oh yeah yeah I have to Im your fianc Peter Von Nostrand
  Why dont you just commit yourself already
  What is so special about this jacket
  He believes it possesses some extraordinary power over women
  Whats the smudge on your hand
  Oh I got stamped at the reggae lounge last night Yeah Im going back there tonight you know Im not gonna pay another cover charge
  What you didnt wash all day
  Yeah I washed just not the hand You wouldnt believe the women at this club Ohh man
  Its amazing how many beautiful women live in New York I actually find it kind of intimidating
  Well youre as pretty as any of them you just need a nose job
  Kramer
  What What
  How could you say something like that
  What What do you mean I just said she needs a nose job
  No no theres nothing wrong with her nose Im so sorry Audrey
  No its ok
  What did you have to say that for
  Well I was just trying to help out
  Yeah Well you can kiss that jacket goodbye Mr Von Nozzin
  You see what happens when you try to be nice
  Elaine said I could stay with her another month until Tina gets back What are you thinking about
  Thinking Nothing What could I possibly be thinking
  You look like youve got something on your mind
  Oh yeah right I wish I had something on my mind pregnant pause So how about that Kramer huh
  How about him
  They way he just says stuff
  He sure does
  Yeah Yeah hes quite a character
  So what did you think
  About the pizza
  No about the nose job
  Oh the nose job I dont know what did you think
  Well Ive thought about it but I dont know
  Yeah another pause Not that I care one way or the other but these doctors today really do amazing things you know if you were so inclined And again Im not suggesting
  I know theyre good
  Peter Jennings had one
  Really
  Probably They all do In my high school half my graduating class had them Of course Im from Long Island so
  Uh huh
  Its really nothing its like going to the dentist
  I hate the dentist
  Its a cleaning
  So you really think I should do this
  If it makes you happy I dont focus on these things I will tell you this Unfortunately we live in a very superficial society I dont condone it but its a fact of life
  Well maybe I should
  What the hell
  barging in Aw now you talked her into getting a nose job
  Me I didnt say anything
  You encouraged her to get one
  I didnt encourage No encourage
  Peter Jennings had one
  Its possible
  Well I think you should accept her for who she is
  No George is right I want to get one
  I think its a mistake
  Me too really Unless youd really like to get one
  Im going straight to hell no two ways about it
  Well it might not be hell but youre gonna run into some bad dudes
  checking his watch Hey lets get the check shes taking the bandages off at four oclock
  We have time
  Its exciting isnt it Shes gonna have a whole new face
  It is exciting
  Of course not as exciting as miss crop circles but
  Please please Isabel She is the most despicable woman I have ever met in my life I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so attracted to them physically at the same time Its like my brain is facing my penis in a chess game And Im letting him win
  Youre not letting him win He wins till youre forty
  Then what
  He still wins but its not a blowout
  She wants to be an actress She makes me read these moronic acting scenes with her and I do it because Im so addicted to the sex Im helpless Ill do anything So finally Kramer comes in the other day
  holding up a piece of paper I dont want to see this woman anymore but I havent got the will power to throw out her number Please help me Help me
  taking the paper and tearing it to pieces Im proud of you
  So Im never gonna see her again Im going cold turkey
  Good for you
  Ill tell you the sex I mean I was like an animal I mean it was just completely uninhibited
  Its like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring
  Its not like that at all
  How do you even know the jacket is there
  Well I dont Im guessing
  Okay look Audrey before you take the bandage off just remember that I was the one that encouraged you to do this you know Now that youre gonna be a great beauty lets not forget how this all began You know like if youd listened to your friend Elaine

  reading Owen March prominent author and essayist suffered a stroke yesterday in the upper West Side apartment of a friend
  Uh huh thats the guy that was here Youre the friend
  continuing The extent of the damage would have been far less severe had paramedics been able to reach him sooner
  Oh lord
  finishing The commotion also delayed production of a Woody Allen movie that was shooting up the block A spokeswoman for the legendary filmmaker said that Mr Allen was extremely agitated and wondered if his days of shooting movies in New York were over
  Five seconds Jerry I was five seconds away from breaking up with him Five seconds The next words out of my mouth were Owen its over
  Can he communicate
  Yeah well he nods And I think he understands me he seems to enjoy it when I read to him
  Alright shes free Steps up to the counter Hi I called before uh my car got smashed
  So listen what should I do I mean if I break up with him now itll look like Im abandoning him because of his condition Ill be ostracized from the community
  What community Theres a community
  Of course theres a community
  All these years Im living in a community I had no idea
  Sir the estimate on the damage to your car is two thousand eight hundred and sixtysix dollars
  Hmm well I got the insurance and everything so

  Yeah chambermaids Im attracted to them too
  Why is that
  Its a woman in your room So go ahead
  So she starts vaccuming back and forth back and forth her hips swivelling her breasts uh trying to think of a word
  Convulsing
  Convulsing
  I dont know Im trying to help you
  Then I asked her if she wanted a drink
  You dont drink
  I know but I couldnt think of anything else to say to her
  So you started drinking
  So we started drinking and Ill tell you I dont know if it was the alcohol or the ammonia but the next think I knew she was mopping the floor with me
  So how was it
  Well the sex was okay but I threw up from the Hennigans
  Good thing the cleaning lady was there
  Dick was fired
  You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over to the right and none of this would have happened
  You knew he was an alcoholic Whyd you put the drink down at all
  What are you saying
  Im not saying anything
  Youre saying something
  What could I be saying
  Well youre not saying nothing you must be saying something
  If I was saying something I would have said it
  Well why dont you say it
  I said it
  What did you say
  Nothing Its exhausting being with you
  Yeah
  over the speaker Its George
  Come on up
  Hey let me ask you something something Did George buy that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper Jerry is unconfortable Ooookay you just gave me the answer
  No I didnt
  Yes you did yes you did I saw your expression
  I didnt have an expression I have a deviated septum I have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe
  How much did he save
  Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question Elaine sticking out her tongue like she isnt buying a word of it of me that you would think  the only surprise is how you could even think of that Thats what you were seeing
  I have to talk to Elaine This cleaing lady is turning the screws on me Shes pushing for this whole relationship thing She keeps calling me threatening to go to the boss with this thing I could lose my job I gotta do something to keep her quiet
  Elaine is in the bathroom Shes wise to whole red dot thing Shes asking me all kinds of questions
  Did you tell her anything
  No
  Do you swear
  Im not swearing I dont want to swear
  Oh you told her didnt you
  No
  Hey George did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot was on it because you could get it at a discount
  What Did I what
  You did didnt you
  Elaine Im Im shocked Im shocked Here I go out in the spirit of the season Elaine looking like shes not buying a word of it and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas
  Well Jerry told me that you did
  You told her How could you tell her I told you not to say anything
  I didnt tell her you stupid idiot She tricked you
  Elaine you dont understand I had 103 temperature when I bought that sweater I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it I couldnt distinguish one red dot from another I couldnt afford anything I have nothing I havent worked for a really long time Jerry is standing right behind George Jerry takes out a hankerchief and starts fakecrying in it I mean look I have no clothes look at what Im wearing Its just a little red dot
  This is for you
  Oh Georgie you bought this for me Oh I knew you cared for me
  As you care for me Which is why it is very important that you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the you know What with Clarence Thomas and everything
  Okay okay can I open it now
  Yes of course go ahead My guess is youre going to like this very much
  Oh Is that cashmere
  Of course its cashemere
  A cashmere sweater Oh Georgie Porgie
  Just a little something for Christmas
  When I was a little girl in Panama a rich American came to our town and he was wearing the softest most beautiful sweater I said to him what do you call this most beautiful fabric and he said they call it cashmere I repeated the words cashmere cashmere I asked if I could have it and he said No Get away from me Then he started walk away But I grabbed onto his leg screaming for him to give me the sweater and he dragged me through the street And then he kicked at me with the other foot and threw some change at me Oh but I didnt want the change Georgie I wanted the cashmere
  I had a feeling you would like it No dont try it on now try it on later
  Wow look at this It feels so beautiful
  Take it off Youre going to ruin it
  noticing the dot Whats this
  I was in the mens room the other day and they had the hand blower instead of the paper towels you know this thing I like the hand blower I have to say It takes a little bit longer but I feel when youre in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can
  The only stench is comming from you
  Oooooh
  Oh wait a second I believe we have a heckler ladies and gentlemen Hey Dick I dont know what your problem is Its not my fault youre back on the wagon
  Its off the wagon
  In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town
  I dont know
  On the wagon Dont you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way
  You cant drink on a wagon it would be too bumpy
  They had smooth trails What about the Cumberland Gap
  What the hell do you know about wagons
  I know enough not to get on them
  Im going to get right to the point It has come to my attention that you and the cleaning woman have engaged in sexual intercourse on the desk in your office Is that correct
  Who said that
  She did
  Was that wrong Should I have not done that I tell you I gotta plead ignorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frouned upon you know cause Ive worked in a lot of offices and I tell you peope do that all the time
  Youre fired
  Well you didnt have to say it like that
  I want you out of here by the end of the day
  What about the whole Christmas spirit thing Any flexability there
  Nah Wait wait she wanted me to give you this
  You had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman
  You never had sex in the office before
  No I once made out with someone but that was it
  Alright so you made out with someone
  Well thats not sex
  Kissing is sex
  Kissing is not sex
  George
  Jerry
  Hey did Jerry leave that drink next to Dicks on purpose
  No
  George
  Over here
  What are you doing here
  Im taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up
  Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place
  I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance
  So George told me that you left the drink next to Dicks on purpose
  Nice try So guess who heckled me at the club last night
  Merry Christmas
  Oh my god thats Dick Its Cape Fear
  Hide hide under the desk
  Ow ow move over
  Get off of me
  Ive got no room
  Is that cashmere
  Of course its cashmere
  noticing the dot Whats this
  But in a way I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic I hate being around alcoholics because theyre either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you And those are the two statements that scare me the most But I think hes okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me Hes finally off the wagon
  You mean on the wagon
  Dont get smart

  I told her wed all go out afterwards okay And dont applaud when she stops playing the first time Its not over yet
  quickly whispering I resent that you said that Thats directed at me isnt it
  Is this okay Can I do this he claps
  Something I said no response Its John Mollika
  Oh oh John Oh hi John Hi
  Whatre you doing down here
  Oh I was just at this recital and Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg and I started laughing
  Jerrys in there I heard you guys broke up
  We did Were just hanging out
  REally  You really look great
  Oh uh thank you Are you still friends with Richie Appel
  Oh Richie hes been doing comedy in L A for a few years He just got back a month ago Hes kind of messed up On drugs I dont know what to do for the guy
  Have you thought about an intervention
  Whats that
  You get all his friends in a room They confront himm to try to get him into rehab Its a very popular thing now
  Hed never listen to anyone  Except of course Jerry Hed listen to Jerry Jerry would have to be involved He really respects Jerry
  Im sorry George Im sorry
  What did you put the Pez dispenser on her leg for in the first place
  I dunno it was an impulse
  What kind of a sick impulse does that
  How could I know she would start to laugh
  Im sorry Im sorry I am
  Can we just go in already
  What are we gonna tell her
  Ill tell her I was the one who laughed
  No dont say a word If she thinks my friends are jerks then Im a jerk
  To Jerry Oh remind me to talk to you about something later
  What about
  Hey hey Were discussing something
  I know but Im distracted now
  What are you A baby All right Tell her
  When I was outside I ran into John Mollika
  Really John Mollika they guy that used to bartend at the Comedy Club Hows he doing
  Hes good
  Uh can we cut to the chase
  Cut to the chase
  Yeah
  Whatre you Joe Hollywood
  A lot of people say it
  I would lose that
  Accusingly Whats that
  Lose that Thats not a Hollywood expression
  Realizing full well it isnt Yes it is
  Anyway  So John told me that Richie is in town from Los Angeles and hes really messed up on drugs So I told him that he should do an intervention
  Really an intervention 
  Yknow people we got a situation over here
  Yeah but he wants you to be a part of it
  Me Why me
  Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to you
  Yknow these things are really hard to load
  All right OK Im goin in
  Weve got to talk about this to Elaine
  All right
  Hi hi hi You were wonderful
  No
  Oh these are my friends Elaine and Jerry  Noel
  You play a Hell of a piano
  Yeah I was really moved really moved
  Well didnt you hear that person laughing I couldnt play I was humiliated
  Well Im sure it wasnt at you
  Well then what was she laughing at
  Pez
  Uh no No thank you Did you see her
  Me uh uh no 
  Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant
  Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg
  Even if this so called mental defective did put something on her leg shes still the one who laughed
  Ill never forget that laugh for the rest of my life exits
  Im sure she would apologize if she could Probably somebody is holding her back against every fibre in her being
  If she wants to continue to have a fibre of her being shell be very careful hitting each other
  All right so are you ready so well go out and get something to eat
  I dont feel like it tonight
  Well be outside
  Yeah
  It was nice meeting you By the way How do you warm up your fingers before you play
  I just crack my knuckles
  Well have a good time
  I dont feel like it
  Ah come on
  I said I DONT FEEL LIKE IT
  Um all right um uh Ill call ya Ill call you and well talk on the phone A telephone communiqu Every thing is fine ok uh fine  exits
  You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place
  What How
  A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team Kramer was our first baseman You couldnt get anything by him It was unbelievable Anyway this one game we came back to win from like 8 runs behind So Kramer says to Richie why dont you dump the bucket of Gatorade on Marty Bensons head The club owner So Richie goes ahead and does it
  So What happened
  What happened The guy was like 67 years old it was freezing out he caught a cold got pneumonia and a month later he was dead
  Shut up
  All the comedians were happy He was one of these club owners nobodu liked anyway But Richie was never the same
  Whar about Kramer
  Hes the same
  Are you sure you want me John I have spoken to Richie in two years I dont have a good apartment for an intervention The furniture its very nonconfrontational All right All right Goodbye to Kramer Remember Ricie Appel
  looks shocked Oh sure the guy I told to pour the Gatorade that killed Marty Benson
  Right well John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention for him Were having it here
  Can I get in on that
  What do you think Its like a poker game
  Is Elaine going
  Yeah
  Well I knew him as well as she did
  Yeah but John invited her
  So what are you saying you dont want me to intervene
  No intervene go intervene all you want I am just afraid you might be interfering while were intervening
  Its George
  Stop smelling your arm
  You know I got a great idea for a cologne The Beach You spray it on and you smell like you just came home from the beach
  Hum a cologne that smells like the beach I cant believe Im saying this Thats not a bad idea

  Yeah Postum is underratted
  Anyway there was all this tension I asked her if she wanted to go out to dinner and she said no maybe we could get together for lunch You know what that means
  Whats wrong with lunch
  Lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner you dont move back to lunch Its like being demoted Ill never do another crossword puzzle with her again I know it
  I like the Jumble You ever do the Jumble
  I have no power Do you understand I need hand I have no hand
  Break up with her
  What
  You break up with her You reverse everything that way
  A preemptive breakup
  A preemptive breakup This is an incredible idea I got nothing to lose We either break up which she would do anyway but at least I go out with some Dignity Completely turn the tables Its absolutely brilliant
  So I am have to going to break up with you
  Youre breaking up with me

  Thats not too bad Its not like a Sunny von Bulow comma The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime
  You know why he did this Because I told him it was over I did not want to see him anymore
  Really Its over
  I could not stand it another minute Yesterday he turned over a mans hot dog stand because he thought the man was looking at me And then after he saw you in the hall Ach he was crazy with jealousy
  Oh boy did he say anything about me
  He does not like you And all indications are he does not like Drakes Coffee Cake
  He said that
  He was screaming about it all night How its too sweet and it falls apart when you eat it
  Im sorry if I caused any trouble I was just being friendly
  I wasnt
  You werent
  No I have thought about you many times Have you thought about me
  Of course
  Tell me everything
  Are you sure he cant hear anything   MARTIN MARTIN
  I wish he was not in a coma I wish he was dead I wish I could pull the plug out from him
  I would I would wait on that I know how you feel but Juries today you never know how theyre going to look at a thing like this
  I saw you looking at your watch You want to leave Go ahead
  No I just wanted to see what time it was
  Are you afraid of him
  No
  Then kiss me
  Here
  Yes right here
  Is this the proper venue
  You dont want to
  No no I want to I I very much want to I I desire to I I pine to
  Then kiss me right in front of him
  I cant What if he wakes up
  A man is lying here unconscious and youre afraid of him What kind of a man are you
  A man who respects a good comma If it was one of those in and out comas maybe But when a guys got a coma going like this  you dont want to mess with it
  Hey
  Hey
  Did you hear about Martin
  Yeah I heard
  I cant believe hes in a coma
  Hes got my vacuum cleaner You know I loaned it to him He never returned it The carpets are filthy What am I going to do
  Who told you about Martin
  Newman Hes good friends with him
  Oh big mouth Newman I should have guessed
  Hes got all of my attachments you know
  Hey let me ask you something How long do you have to wait for a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his exgirlfriend out
  What Gina Why wait Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian
  You know I dont get that whole suicide machine Theres no tall buildings where these people live They cant wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person
  So whats going on between you and Gina
  Well I went with her to the hospital last night
  Uh uh
  So were in the room and shes trying to get me to kiss her right in front of him
  Uh uh you see thats the great thing about Mediterranean women All right so what did you do
  Nothing
  Ah what kind of a man are you The guy is unconscious in a coma and you dont have the guts to kiss his girlfriend
  I didnt know what the coma etiquette was
  There is no coma etiquette You see thats the beauty of the coma man It doesnt matter what you do around it
  So youre saying his girl his car his clothes its all up for grabs You can just loot the coma victim
  Id give him 24 hours to get out of it They cant get out of it in 24 hours its a land rush
  So if the coma victim wakes up in a month hes thrilled he got out of the coma He goes home theres nothing left
  NOTHING LEFT Thats why Im trying to get that vacuum cleaner Because somebodys going to grab it
  Martins spirit came to you as a warning
  Why would he come to George
  Because George has heightened extra sensory perception FAYGY GET YOUR FINGER OUT OF YOUR NOSE
  I knew it I always felt different
  You are Some coffee cake
  Drakes

  I never assisted in a birth before Its really quite disgusting
  What did she name the kid
  You wouldnt believe it Rasputin
  Heey
  Hey
  Hey
  when did you get back
  A couple of hours ago
  So how was it
  George I would like to thank you for the greatest four days I ever spent in my life
  osh
  They were shooting the Sports Illustrated swim suit issue right in the hotel pool
  Woah hitting George
  Not only that but at the hotel they opened up this area on the beach for nude bathing and all of the Sports Illustrated models went down there
  Wow hitting George
  I was on the next blanket from Elle McPherson
  Oh hitting George
  We played Backgammon in the nude
  Oh hitting George
  Shes a sweet kid
  Nude backgammon with swimsuit models
  Oh you know what The second day I was there I stepped on a jellyfish Now it kind of stung my foot Thats probably what Rula was trying to warn you about
  Yeah you gotta watch for the jellyfish
  Yeah
  Whats this
  Oh its an invitation to a house warming from Martin and Gina
  They moved in together
  Yeah its some place down in the village
  Phew
  Yeah
  Its Elaine
  All right were coming down
  Hey where ya going
  Were taking Elaine to dinner Shes got to start the fast again Um you want to go
  Um Id like to but a bunch of us from the islands well be getting together
  Elle McPherson going to be there
  OH I got to call her back
  Why even try anymore Theres no sense to it Im never gonna meet anybody I should just accept it
  Oh yes you will
  No I wont
  Yeah maybe you wont
  I mean its hard enough to meet a woman you dislike much less like
  Are my nostrils getting bigger
  No Why must it be so difficult Why is there all this tension and hostility Why cant I just walk up to a woman on the street and say Hi Im
  Theres just no men out there you know
  I know
  I mean the problem is that the good ones know theyre good And they know theyre in such demand theyre just not interested in confining themselves to one person
  I hate the good ones
  Is Jerry one of the good ones
  Thats a good question I think he thinks he is
  Well the mediocre ones are available but theyre so insecure about not being one of the good ones that theyre always going Well Im not good enough for you what are you doing with me and eventually I just go Youre right
  You know maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre
  No maybe I need somebody who has nothing somebody who just has to appreciate being with me because hes so desperate
  I mean its gotten to the point where Im flirting with operators on the phone I almost made a date with one
  Oh so theres still hope
  I dont want hope Hope is killing me My dream is to become hopeless When youre hopeless you dont care and when you dont care that indifference makes you attractive
  Oh so hopelessness is the key
  Its my only hope
  See I wouldnt really mind so much but I feel badly for my mother I mean if my mother werent around it wouldnt be so bad But Im telling you if Im not married by the time Im forty Im gonna have to kill her because its the only fair thing to do I just couldnt put her through that
  Well at least youre not bitter
  Who says Im not bitter
  Arent you too young to be bitter
  No you can be young and bitter just maybe not as bitter as Im gonna be ten years from now but Im bitter Anyway dont tell anyone
  Dont worry your bitterness is safe with me
  Um order me a piece of cake Im gonna go throw up
  Look at my hands Look Filthy from the paper You know they should give you a Wetnap when you buy one like at those rib joints
  So whatd you do last night
  Went out with George you
  Went out with Cynthia
  How was it Whatd you talk about
  Well you know the usual The Federal Reserve the rainforest Cynthia thought we should nuke the rainforest you know get rid of it in one fell swoop so we can at least eliminate it as a subject of conversation What about you
  We brushed on that Actually George was in rare form He just cant find anybody
  I know Cynthia too Shes really given up
  George too
  Yeah right
  Ive never fixed anybody up
  Uh me neither and I am not about to start with George
  Well why wouldnt you start with George You think shes too good for George
  I didnt say too good did I say too good

  Hes George
  Shes Cynthia
  So what
  What you dont think shes beautiful
  I dont know whats with the eyebrows
  You know what your problem is Your standards are too high

  Well let me tell you something about George He is fast He can run like the wind And hes strong Ive seen him lift a hundred pounds over his head without even knowing it And you wouldnt know it to look at him but George can bait a hook

  to Jerry Do you perform anywhere in new York right now

  Let me tell it 
  No you cant tell it 
  You always tell it 
  All right tell it
  Ja ja ja  just tell it
  June 14 1987 Mets Phillies Were enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the right field stands when a crucial Hernandez error to a five run Phillies ninth Cost the Mets the game
  Our day was ruined There was a lot of people you know they were waiting by the players parking lot Now were coming down the ramp  cut to film of the day  like the Zabruter film  with the Umbrella man and everything  Oh so brilliant parody  Newman was in front of me Keith was coming toward us as he passes Newman turns and says  Nice game pretty boy Keith continued past us up the ramp
  A second later something happened that changed us in a deep and profound way front that day forward
  What was it
  He spit on us and I screamed out Im hit
  Then I turned and the spit ricochet of him and it hit me
  Wow What a story
  Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as Ive heard this story a number of times
  Newman Kramer if youll indulge me According to your story Keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking Newman between the third and forth rib The spit then cam off the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap The spit then splashed off the wrist Pauses In mid air mind you makes a left turn and lands on Newmans left thigh That is one magic luggie
  Well thats the way it happened
  What happened to your head when you got hit
  Well uh well my head went back and to the left
  Again
  Back and to the left
  Back and to the left Back and to the left
  So what are you saying
  I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind  that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road If the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward
  So the spit could have only come from the front and to the right
  But that is not what they would have you believe
  Im leavin Jerrys a nut Exits
  Wait wait Exits
  The sad thing is we may never know the real truth
  Frantically Did anybody call here asking for Vandelay industries
  No What happened to you
  Now listen closely I was at the unemployment office and I told them that I was very close to getting a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number So when now when the phone rings youve got to answer Vandelay Industries
  Im Vandelay Industries
  Right
  And what is that
  Youre in latex
  Latex And what do I do with latex
  Ya manufacture it
  Here in this little apartment
  And what do I say about you
  Youre considering hiring me for your latex salesman
  Im going to hire you as my latex salesman
  Right
  I dont think so Why would I do that
  Because I asked you to
  If you think Im looking for someone to just sit at a desk pushing papers around you can forget it I have enough headaches just trying to manufacture the stuff
  Yeah
  Its Keith
  All right were coming down
  KEITH HERNANDEZ
  Yeah come on Elaine lets go

  Nice looking Lugar
  Im standing in front of the Paramount adjacent to Madison Square Garden where a growing number of vociferous and angry demonstrators are gathering to protest the very first public appearance of Donald OBrien the leader of the midwestern regional chapter of the Aryan Union and reputed to be their most charismatic spokesman The reclusive Mr OBrien is an advocate of the violent overthrow of the government He has openly professed a deep admiration of Adolf Hitler Even David Duke has denounced him as a dangerous extremist There is a full house inside awaiting his arrival from the airport Sources tell me he is in route and should be arriving momentarily Police have set up barricades but quite frankly Bill and Jean I dont think theyre any match for the emotional fuse that has been lit here tonight Reporting from the Paramount Im Jodi Baskerville back to you in the studio
  Somethings very strange George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and wanna be called OBrien and Murphy OBrien OBrien why OBrien

  I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy
  Hes extremely Murphy Hes Murphy to a fault
  Where are you from
  Dublin Originally Parents came over here when I was eighteen Cereal famine Couldnt get a bowl anywhere Bad Tis a beautiful country though lush rolling hills and the peat ah the peat
  Sounds more like Scottish
  We were right on the border
  Maybe hes with the company
  What
  The CIA Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization from within
  What about his comedy act
  Thats the perfect cover All that time on the road Look Jerry hes too normal to be a comedian These comedians theyre sick neurotic people
  What about George
  What about him hes part of it His whole personality is a disguise No real person can act the way he does Elaine Im telling you theyre with the organization Theyre all part of it Hes in there with Helms and Hunt and Liddy that whole crowd George and Jerry they probably know who killed Kennedy
  Ill bet they were even in on it
  Alright what are we gonna do Im not gonna let him hurt you grabs and hugs Elaine tightly Im not gonna
  Kramer youre hurting me
  Those are my friends I was telling you about Were gonna talk to them pull over
  Get off of me
  OBrien

  Yeah thats him
  Look theres OBrien
  Filthy nazi bastard
  Lets get him
  What do I do What do I do
  Get in the car Get in the car
  pointing to Jerry OBrien Long time no see Hows tricks Murphy
  Why did you call him OBrien and him Murphy
  No he was talking to me hes crosseyed
  It could be very confusing
  Yeah Eva
  Its for me takes phone Hello cups receiver Its OBrien
  OBrien Well thats weird
  gun drawn Who are you
  A limousine has just pulled up its being surrounded by a huge group of protestors this has the makings of a very ugly scene
  They are banging on the car trying to flip it over The police seem unable or unwilling to control the crowd I would imagine Mr OBrien must be having some very grave doubts if he made the right choice for his first public appearance
  Get out
  Look its Dan Hi Dan
  Elaine
  Hey
  I am not OBrien I am not OBrien Im not OBrien Ask anyone Jerry Jerry
  You know its bad enough you have a car phone you have to use the speaker
  Its safer Plus its more annoying to the other person
  Oh look at this guy

  Oh theres a guy trying to get in front of me he has to ask permission Yes Go ahead Get in get in
  Did you get a thank you wave
  No nothing How could you not give a thank you wave Hey buddy Wheres my thank you wave
  Give me that wave
  Jerry are you free on Friday
  Yeah Im free why
  Ah God I bumped into Robin Sandusky today she asked me to have dinner with her and her husband
  Oh my God You wont believe what I just saw A car just bashed into a parked car and sped off right on my block
  You gotta follow that car
  What
  You cant let him get away with that
  Elaine the guy could be dangerous
  What are you yellow
  Im not yella In a cowboy voice
  Jerry if you dont follow him youre yella
  Wait he stopped hes parking
  What What I cant hear you Jerry
  Uh excuse me uh I was uh driving behind you uh a few blocks back and I I couldnt help uh maybe you didnt realize uh I witnessed that uh um youre tires a little low That can affect the performance of the twin highbeam suspension not to mention your rack and pinion steering
  So I wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her
  Boy What a story Im speechless Speechless I have no speech
  You know I really liked her We talked We flirted And when she left she reached out and touched my arm
  He he he Simulating her feminine laugh
  I love when they touch your arm I cant get enough of that Why is that
  Lets not even analyze it
  So you didnt turn her in
  I wanted to but I couldnt go through with it
  Gonna see her again
  Friday night
  Yep
  Its me
  Come on up
  By the way Elaine does not need to know about anything
  Hey hey hey I dig
  Oh you dig
  Yes I see enormous potential here
  Why
  Because great couples always have a great story about how they met Thats why Ive never been in a long term relationship Ive never had a good meeting story
  I wonder if Im nuts for pursuing this woman at all
  I dont think so
  Look she slammed into a parked car She took no responsibility for mutilating the property of a stranger then she sped off like a criminal
  On the other hand does that mean she should never be allowed to date again You scratch one car and youre forbidden to have social contact for the rest of your life
  What am I drinking milk
  Hey
  Hi
  Sweater
  Thank you
  So What happened
  With that
  With the car
  What car
  The hit and run
  Oh right right right right right right right the hit and run Well Actually the guy went into Queens
  Queens You followed him over the bridge
  Over the bridge Making a pointing motion with his hand
  Oh well I didnt know you went into Queens Jerry
  Yeah Queens
  So Then what
  So he gets out of the car I say Hey buddy I saw you hit that car So he says to me What are ya gonna do about it
  So I said to him Whatevers necessary
  I am speechless I am without speech
  Tell her about the shoving
  What
  What shoving
  Oh it was nothing
  No Tell her
  Well he kinda lost his temper and he was pushing me up against the car So I went into a karate stance Jerry assumes karate position and does two punches
  You know karate
  I know a little
  Well this is so amazing to me Jerry what did do
  He backed off Pretty pathetic actually
  Hey Group does likewise
  Did you tell Kramer
  Ah nah Waving his hand and walking away
  What What What Tell me
  Jerry saw this guy crash into a car and he followed him
  Good for you What kind of a sick lowlife would do a thing like that You know those people you know theyre mentally disturbed Pointing a finger at Jerry
  They should be sent to Australia
  Australia
  Yeah yeah thats where England used to send their convicts
  But not anymore
  No
  Hey Kramer Kramer
  Yeah
  What happened to you right here She pointing to her forehead
  I dont know
  You know I was watching Entertainment Tonight and uh suddenly I got dizzy And the next thing I know I hit my head on the coffee table
  Well that is that is strange
  Yep Mumbles off
  Alright oh Jerry were still on for Friday night right
  Oh Friday I cant Im sorry I have a date
  But last night you said you were free Sounding very disappointed
  We just met
  Maybe it was a reaction to the sardines
  But I I cant go alone
  Ask George to go with you
  George come on Ill pay for you
  Youll pay Im there
  Why do you even need anybody
  Because I hate being at a table alone with a married couple Talking about their married friends and their married furniture Theyre always trying to make me feel like their life is so much better than mine You know I have a very exciting life Its very exciting As shes closing the door to leave
  You went out with a bullfighter
  Yes well an exbullfighter now
  Wow
  What was his name
