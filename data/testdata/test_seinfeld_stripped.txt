  Kirk Douglas Now theres another very bad driver But hes such an unbelievable guy that when he hits someone he doesnt even leave a note He sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up so he can exchange license registration and apologize
  I said God bless you Was that so wrong
  The question is did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his God bless you Because as the husband he has the right to first refusal
  Its me
  Come on up
  Yes yes I definitely waited But let me say this Once he passes on that option that God bless you is up for grabs
  No argument Unless shes one of these multiple sneezers and hes holding his God bless you in abeyance until she completes the series
  Well I dont think she is a multiple sneezer because she sneezed again later and it was also a single
  What if shes having an off night
  Hi
  Hi
  Well If it isnt mister gesuntheit
  Oh ya like theres something wrong with saying God bless you I was raised to say God bless you
  Ah shut up

  Mary Hart
  God
  What
  Well she apologized and then she wanted to know if we could get together Wednesday afternoon
  Get together
  Maybe she just wants to talk to me
  Married women dont get together They have affairs
  Oh my God an affair Thats so adult Its like with stockings and martinis and William Holden On the other hand it probably wouldnt cost me any money
  Are you actually considering this
  I cant have an affair with a married woman thats despicable
  Yeah its like hitting a car and driving away without leaving a note
  Yeah
  Hey you know who owns that car

  The blond with the blue sweatpants
  Well who is she
  Ive had a crush on this woman for year Ive always been afraid to approach her She looks like she belongs on one of these Hallmark cards
  Oh right right The blue sweatpants Gees its too bad you cant say anything because of Angela
  Oh yeah Too bad Angela Lousy thug I mean what kind of sick person does something like that That woman belongs in prison I mean I actually owe it to society to do something about this I cant sit by and allow this to go on Its a moral issue is what it is
  You cant compromise your principles
  How am I going to live with myself
  Cant live
  Im not religious but I certainly know where to draw the line
  This country needs more people like you
  Dont sell yourself short saying God bless you to every Tom Dick and Harry in great personal risk
  I believe strongly in that as you know
  There should be more people like us
  Thats why the worlds in the shape its in
  Youre telling me
  Anyway I just wanted you to know that Im going to do everything I can to make sure the party responsible is made to be responsible or something very close to that

  Well I dont know he caught me off guard
  You lie How hard is it to lie

  She told this couple she had an affair with a matador
  A matador Well well well Uno momento por favor Pray tell what was the young mans name

  He is
  Oh he is fantastic And then they fired a gun right up in the air
  A gun
  I think it was a gun And then they followed us all the way into the city and then they just stopped and they turned around and they went home

  Bad rap
  Yeah From you
  Me
  You heard me So he packed it up and split for the coast LaLa Land LA
  LA
  I never should have taken his keys away But he drove me to it I had no choice He wouldnt take em back Elaine you saw it remember I said Take the keys back He wouldnt do anything You saw it didnt you see it
  Yeah yeah I saw it mutters under her breath I mean its complete bullshit
  Huh
  What
  No whatd you say
  Nothing I didnt say anything
  Oh you didnt see it
  Yeah I saw it I saw it I did I saw it Yep
  I heard you say something there
  I didnt say anything
  Im calling Kramers mother Picks up the phone dials To Elaine I dont know what you said But it was something I heard something Hello Hello Mrs Kramer Mrs Kramer Could you turn the music down Could you turn the music down
  Ask her about Kramer
  Shes drunk out of her mind
  Elaine Are you there Its me Im locked out of my apartment I need my spare keys Where are you Im at the coffee shop
  Hey You ever been in an accident
  About five years ago I was going down this very road Same time of day going about the same speed Im going nowthere was a rock in the road Couldnt have been more than a pebble Never really saw it Lost control of the bike went flyin about a hundred feet  came down right on my head Cracked it wide open Blood and stuff was just splattered all over the road thereI broke every bone in my face Hey you know when they found me my eyes were hanging out of their sockets Yeah they pronounced me dead at the scene I was in a coma forwell they told me about a yearsaid Id be a vegetable for life Yeah but I showed em Ever since then I always wear a helmet The biker goes into a turn Lean Kramer yells
  Georgie Boy Way to come through with the keys Sit down Im buying you dinner
  Look I gotta tell yaI been thinkin about it I just dont feel right about letting you into Elaines apartment
  Dont feel right What are you talking about
  Well you know I shouldnt have let you into Kramers now you want to go into Elainesshe entrusted me with her spare keys how can I just let you in
  What is the big deal
  Just because you have someones spare keys it doesnt entitle you to break into their apartment Thats the reason you took away Kramers keys
  First of all youre not even supposed to have Elaines keys Youre supposed to give em back to her so she can give em back to me because she has mine So technically those are my keys
  Yes well if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer he never would have taken his back from you and given em to me in which case I wouldnt have had to take mine back from her
  Well I want those keys Tries to grab the keys from George
  Nope no can do
  George give them to me I want these keys They struggle over the keys I dont want to get physical
  Do you wanna fight
  Do you wanna fight
  Ill fight ya Not the face Not the face The struggle continues
  And then the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome young prince
  Oh no He didnt take back the keys no way
  Yes And then the handsome young prince was cast out into the cruel cruel world
  Oh man what a bummer That ogre dudes pretty cold huh
  Oh hes cold
  Lemme tell you something Kramer If that ogre dude pulled that crap on me pulls out a knife  ID STAB HIM ID CUT HIM IN HALF ID GUT HIM LIKE A FISH MAN Thats what Id do
  Yeah yeahthatd be funny To driver Hey you can drop me here
  Hey whats the rush man
  Well you know I gotta be goin now
  Hey Kramer  have you ever killed a man
  What do you think junior You think these hands have been soakin in Ivory liquid mimics choking somebody
  Dont leave Kramer stay with us You know so much about the world we need you please Kramer they all start chanting Please Kramer Please Kramer Scene ends with Kramer trying to escape their clutches
  Dont you see Youre just avoiding the middle man You were gonna give her her spare keys so she was gonna give em to me So all thats happening is that instead of giving them to her youre giving them to me Its just unfortunate that when she gave you yours you didnt give her hers Cause then she would have given em to me because she has mine So then I would have never had to ask you for hers so that I could get mine
  Youre right how did I miss that Begins unlocking the door mutters under his breath Maybe because its a crock of shit
  Whats that
  Nothing
  I heard something
  Didnt say anything They go into Elaines apartment
  So how long you been drivin this thing
  Goin on four years
  Well nothins sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi
  Nothin They exchange a glance then laugh Listen to you youre quite the sweettalker
  You know I always wanted to drive the big rigs I used to watch those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle
  You want to give it a try
  Really
  Do you know how to doubleclutch

  All right so what did they do
  I dont know Maybe they gave out fig leaf clumps to all the soldiers
  Well I think it would be nice if there was some kind of historical record of it
  Maybe they should have a toilet paper museum Would you like that So we could see all the toilet paper advancements down through the ages Toilet paper of the Crusades the development of the perforation the first sixpack

  They want you to do a TV show
  Well they want me to come up with an idea I mean I dont have any ideas
  Come on how hard is that Look at all the junk thats on TV You want an idea Heres an idea You coach gymnastics team in high school And youre married And your sons not interested in gymnastics and youre pushing him into gymnastics
  Why should I care if my sons into gymnastics
  Because youre a gymnastics teacher Its only natural
  But gymnastics is not for everybody
  I know but hes your son
  So what
  All right forget that idea its not for youOkay okay I got it You run an antique store

  And people come in the store and you get involved in their lives
  What person who runs an antique store gets involved in peoples lives
  Why not
  So someone comes in to buy an old lamp and all of a sudden Im getting them out of a jam I could see if I was a pharmacist because a pharmacist knows whats wrong with everybody that comes in
  I know but antiques are very popular right now
  No theyre not they used to be
  Oh yeah like you know
  Oh like you do
  And youre the manager of the circus
  A circus
  Come on this is a great idea Look at the characters Youve got all these freaks on the show A woman with a moustache I mean who wouldnt tune in to see a women with a moustache Youve for the tallest man in the world a guy whos just a head
  I dont think so
  Look Jerry the show isnt about the circus its about watching freaks
  I dont think the network will go for it
  Why not
  Look Im not pitching a show about freaks
  Oh come on Jerry youre wrong People they want to watch freaks This is a cant miss

  So whats happening with the TV show You come up with anything
  No nothing
  Why dont they have salsa on the table
  What do you need salsa for
  Salsa is now the number one condiment in America
  You know why Because people like to say salsa Excuse me do you have salsa We need more salsa Where is the salsa No salsa
  You know it must be impossible for a Spanish person to order seltzer and not get salsa Angry I wanted seltzer not salsa
  Dont you know the difference between seltzer and salsa You have the seltezer after the salsa
  See this should be a show This is the show
  What
  This Just talking
  dismissing Yeah right
  Im really serious I think thats a good idea
  Just talking Well whats the show about
  Its about nothing
  No story
  No forget the story
  Youve got to have a story
  Who says you gotta have a story Remember when we were waiting for for that table in that Chinese restaurant that time That could be a TV show
  And who is on the show Who are the characters
  I could be a character
  You
  Yeah You could base a character on me
  So on the show theres a character named George Costanza
  Yeah Theres something wrong with that Im a character People are always saying to me You know youre a quite a character
  And who else is on the show
  Elaine could be a character Kramer
  Now hes a character Pause So everybody I know is a character on the show
  Right
  And its about nothing
  Absolutely nothing
  So youre saying I go in to NBC and tell them I got this idea for a show about nothing
  We go into NBC
  We Since when are you a writer
  Scoffs Writer Were talking about a sitcom
  You want to go with me to NBC
  Yeah I think we really go something here
  What do we got
  An idea
  What idea
  An idea for the show
  I still dont know what the idea is
  Its about nothing
  Right
  Everybodys doing something well do nothing
  So we go into NBC we tell them weve got an idea for a show about nothing
  Exactly
  They say Whats your show about I say Nothing
  There you go
  Nodding I think you may have something there
  So the show would be about my real life And one of the characters would be based on you
  Thinks No I dont think so
  What do you mean you dont think so
  I dont like it
  I dont understand What dont you like about it
  I dont like the idea of a character based on me
  Why not
  well it just doesnt sit well
  Youre my neighbor Theres got to be a character based on you
  Thats your problem buddy
  I dont understand what the big deal is
  Hey Ill tell you what  you can do it on one condition
  Whatever you want
  I get to play Kramer
  You cant play Kramer
  I am Kramer
  But you cant act
  Phew
  Okay fine Well use Newman
  Newman
  Use me for what
  Nothin What do you want
  Well youll never guess what happened to me today I was uh driving  Jerry and Kramer turn away home on the palisades parkway when I looked in the rear view mirror and what did I see The fuzz And its funny because my new radar detector was on I didnt hear a thing Isnt that strange
  Yeah Thats strange
  A radar detector as I understand it DETECTS RADAR WITH A SERIES OF BEEPS AND FLASHING LIGHTS But oddly for some reason I didnt hear a thing except for the sound of a police siren
  Thats queer uh
  I WANT MY HELMET BACK GIVE ME BACK MY HELMET AND YOURE GOING TO PAY FOR THAT TICKET
  Yeah you better think again Mojumbo
  You gave me a defective detector  Jerry
  Buyer beware
  Are you going to give me back that helmet or not
  No We had a deal There are no guarantees in life
  No but theres karma Kramer
  Karma Kramer
  And one more thing Im not coming to your party exits
  To himself Salsa seltzer Hey excuse me you got any salsa No not selzer salsa George doesnt react Whats the matter
  Nervous Nothing
  You sure You look a little pale
  No Im fine Im good Im very good
  What are you nervous
  No not nervous Im good very good A beat then he snaps I cant do this Cant do this
  What
  I cant do this I cant do it I have tried Im here Its impossible
  This was your idea
  What idea I just said something I didnt know you were going to listen to me
  Dont worry about it Theyre just TV executives
  Theyre men with jobs Jerry They wear suits and ties Theyre married they have secretaries
  I told you not to come
  I need some water I gotta get some water

  Really Thats pretty good
  Oh God its Joe Devola

  Oh God he saw me
  Hello Jerry
  Hey Joe HOW YOU DOING
  Youre under no obligation to shake my hand
  Oh no Just a custom Uh THATS MY FRIEND GEORGE YOU LOOK GOOD
  Why shouldnt I look good
  Oh no reason Youre into karate right
  You want to hit me
  What are you doing here
  I dreopped a script off
  AH GOOD FOR YOU
  Well 
  You dont have to say anything
  No Uh hey I guess Ill see you Sunday night
  Why
  Kramers party
  Kramers  having  a  party
  No no hes not having a party Hes doing something I dont know what it is Its nothing Hes not doing anything
  Gee I thought Kramer and I were very close friends
  No Im sure you are Im sure you are very close friends Very close
  Give my best to Hinckley
  What was that
  I cant believe what I just did I didnt know kramer didnt invite him I better call Kramer 
  Theyre ready for you
  Okay okay Look you do all the talking okay
  Relax Who are they
  Yeah theyre not better than me
  Course not
  Who are they
  Theyre nobody
  What about me
  What about you
  Why them Why not me
  Why not you
  Im as good as them
  Better
  You really think so
  No
  To Jerry laughing about one of his bits The bit the bit I really liked what were the parakeet flew into the mirror Now thats funny
  The parakeet in the mirror Thats a good one Stu
  Yeah its one of my favorites
  What about you George Have you written anything we might know
  Quickly making it up Well possibly I wrote an offBroadway show La Cocina Actually it was offoffBroadway It was a comedy about a Mexican chef
  Oh it was very funny There was one great scene with the chef  what was his name
  Pepe
  Oh Pepe Yeah Pepe And uh he was making tamales
  Oh he actually cooked on the stage
  No no he mimed it Thats what was so funny about it
  So what have you two come up with
  Well weve thought about this in a variety of ways But the basic idea is I will play myself
  Interrupting May I
  Go ahead
  I think I can sum up the show for you with one word NOTHING
  Nothing
  Smiling Nothing
  Unimpressed What does that mean
  The show is about nothing
  To George Well its not about nothing
  To Jerry No its about nothing
  Well maybe in philosophy But even nothing is something
  Mr Dalrymple your niece is on the phone
  Ill call back
  Attempting to spell his last name DALRIMPEL
  Obviously dislikes George Not even close
  Is it with a y
  No
  Whats the premise
  Well as I was saying I would play myself and as a comedian living in New York I have a friend a neighbor and an exgirlfriend which is all true
  Yeah but nothing happens on the show You see its just like life You know you eat you go shopping you read You eat you read You go shopping
  You read You read on the show
  Well I dont know about the reading We didnt discuss the reading
  All right tell me tell me about the stories What kind of stories
  Oh no No stories
  No stories So what is it
  Showing an example Whatd you do today
  I got up and came to work
  Theres a show Thats a show
  Confused How is that a show
  Well uh maybe something happens on the way to work
  No no no Nothing happens
  Well something happens
  Well why am I watching it
  Because its on TV
  Threatening Not yet
  Okay uh look if you want to just keep on doing the same old thing then maybe this idea is not for you I for one am not going to compromise my artistic integrity And Ill tell you something else this is the show and were not going to change it To Jerry Right
  To Russell How about this I manage a circus
  I dont even want to talk about it anymore What were you thinking What was going on in your mind Artistic integrity Where where did you come up with that Youre not artistic and you have no integrity You know you really need some help A regular psychiatrist couldnt even help you You need to go to like Vienna or something You know what I mean You need to get involved at the University level Like where Freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you Thats the kind of help you need Not the once a week for eighty bucks No You need a team A team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you having conferences observing you like the way they did with the Elephant Man Thats what Im talking about because thats the only way youre going to get better
     I thought the woman was kind of cute
  Hold it I really want to be clear about this Are you talking about the woman in the meeting Is that the woman youre talking about
  Yeah I thought I might give her a call I I dont meet that many women I meet like three women a year I mean weve been introduced She knows my name
  ITS COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE
  Why Maybe she liked me I I mean she was looking right at me You know I think she was impressed You know we had good eye contact the whole meeting
  Oh I forgot to call Kramer
  Wait a minute let me call Susan
  No no this is more important
  She might be leaving to work any minute
  No I got to warn him that I told Joe Devola about his party
  No
  What is it
  I was just thinking about this patient of mine
  What
  Just wondering if hes taking his medication
  Well come on were on vacation
  Well we were standing uh inn the waiting area there and you know how Devola is Hes all  buzzer
  Yeah to buzzer
  OC Its George
  And so uh I felt very uncomfortable with him and you know I just blurted out something about your party
  Whoa back up a second
  Well I didnt know that you didnt invite him
  Why would you think I would invite him
  I just a ssumed 
  Assumed Never assume anything I dont want that nut in my house You know hes on medication
  Hello oh hello You remember  Susan from N B C
  Of course How are you
  Fine its good to see you
  And this is Kramer
  Hello
  All right go ahead Susan tell him
  Tell me what

  and SUSAN The third
  Um Uh ugh

  I never should have brought her up there Should have known better Should have seen it coming I didnt see it coming
  I think SHE saw it coming
  You know she was behind the idea She was going to champion the show Thats what I was bring her up there to tell you And she liked me
  Look just because Kramer vomited on her doesnt mean the deal is dead
  What are you crazy Its a traumatic thing to be thrown up on
  Vommiting is not a deal breaker If Hitler had vommited on Chamberlin Chamberlind still would have given him Chekoslovakia
  Chamberlind you could hold his head in nthe toilet hed still give you half of Europe
  What happened to you
  Devola came after me
  What Devola See I told you this guy is crazy I cant believe this What happened

  All right Look Now you promised youre gonna be a little more flexible on the nothing idea okay Jsut a little
  Okay A little
  Okay youre all set You got your story
  No
  When the cop stopped me I told him that I was rushing home because my friend was about to commit suicide
  Uhm
  Now youre that firend Now all we need is a reason why you were going to commit suicide
  I never had an air conditioner
  No Thats no reason to kill yourself
  Why It gets hot at night you cant sleep You ever tried to sleep in a really hot room
  Every night I sleep in a really hot room I dont want to kill myself
  Well I slept in really hot rooms and I wanted to kill myself
  No no no Thats not gonna work Something else
  I was never able to become a banker
  Banker So youre killing yourself because your dreams of becoming a banker have gone unfulfilled Youyouyouyou cant live without being a banker
  Yeah yeah If I cant be banker I dont wanna live
  You must be banker
  MUST be banker
  Okay well go with the banker story
  The story is the foundation of all entertainment You must have a good story otherwise its just masturbation
  And people really have to care about the characters
  Care Forget about care Love They have to love the characters Otherwise why would they keep tuning in
  Wouldnt tune in
  Would they tune in
  No tune
  We like to look at the show as if it were in EKG You have your highs and your lows and it goes up and down
  The show will be like a heart attack
  Just a huge massive coronary
  So what you said last week about no story youre a little flexible on that now
  Isis that what I said no story Because Jerry had to tell me later
  He couldnt believe it
  Laughs snorts I said I said Get outta here No story Is that what I said
  Well I informed him that he was exceeding the speed limit and uh thats when he told me that he was racing home because his friend was about to commit suicide
  And then what happened
  Well then he became very loud and hysterical He was flailing his arms about as he told the story and then he threw himself on the ground and he grabbed me around the legs and then he begged me to let him go And when I refused thats when he began to scream My friends going to die my friends going to die
  Look I dont know how you two guys feel but we would really like to be in business with you
  Well we would like to be in business Lets do business Well have some business Lets have business
  We would love to be in business Well do business Were in business Its its business This is business

  backs his story Hmm hmm
  Thats my vow to you
  Well I got a feeling about you two And even more than that I place a great deal of confidence in that ladys judgment
  Oh Thats good judgment Thats a pile of judgment there Sure
  Oh Tahts judgment Yes yes Judgment with earrings on Yeah
  gets up So lets make a pilot
  I had gone up to Westchester I go there every Tuesday I do charity for the blind in my spare time for the Lighthouse I was in the middle of a game of Parcheesi with an old blind man and I excused myself to call my friend as he was very depressed lately because he never became a banker
  I dont understand
  You see itd been his lifelong dream to be a banker and he uh just the day before he was turned down by another bank I believe it was the Manufacturers Hanover on Lexington and 40th Street That was the third bank to turn him down so I wasI was a little concerned I wanted to see how he was doing Well Your Honor he was barely audible But I distinctly recall him say
  interupts involuntarily Yoyo Ma
  So I sped home to save my friends life and I was stopped for speeding Yes I admit I was speeding but it was to save a mans life A close friend An innocent person who wanted nothing more out of life than to love to be loved and to be a banker
  So then he didnt kill himself
  No sir He did not But only by thge grace of God Hes in the courtroom today
  See

  The Ross house
  The cabin Laughs nervously Well Pauses as he thinks of a way to break the news then decides to pass it off Susan
  Uhh about the cabin
  Cutting her off I love that place My father built that cabin in 1947 My mother was recuperating from Impetigo at the time and dad thought it would be a good idea to get her out into the fresh air She died there the following winter And he passed away 10 years later to the day His last words to me were Mrs Ross bored out of her mind has obviously heard this story a million times  she mouths the words as Mr Ross says them Cherish the cabin Not uh Take care of your sister Adding Shes a paraplegic But Cherish the cabin Smiling reflecting And I have for 45 years Its often been a sanctuary for me
  Annoyingly butting in Kinda like Supermans fortress of solitude
  What
  S uh Superman  he uh built the fortress of solitude up at the North Pole to uh you know sort of get away from it all
  When I go Im passing it on to her Pointing at Susan
  Drunk she laughs out loud Ill take a hotel any day
  Daddy
  Yes
  Daddy about the cabin
  Laughing she points to her shirt Look Henry I spilled wine on me Laughs again
  To Susan What about it
  Well the thing is
  What What is it
  Well the  the cabin is kind of uh George
  Extremely blunt Burned
  Burned
  There was a fire and it uh
  Burned
  Still trying to comprehend what has happened The cabin burned
  Laughs yeah burned Whoo
  Laughing out loud Burned George laughs with her
  Was anything found Was it all burned to the ground Did they find anything
  Solemn No Nothing
  Laughing shes obviously getting a kick out of her husbands misfortune Nothing Ha ha ha
  Eh but you know Mr Ross if  if you look at the whole situating what with it being your cigars and everything its really rather ironic  one might even say in a sense comical Mr Ross has by now left the room Mrs Ross is pointing at George nodding laughing As if to say he hit the bullseye George calls out to Mr Ross Really Think about it
  Jerrys apartment
  Offended I cant believe you said that
  What

  Mesmerized with Kramers body No lets get him in the studio today We can send these out immediately
  Youve done it again CK
  Calvin Klein office building
  An what if I did do it Even though I admit to nothing and never will What does that make me And Im not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there whove been caught Elevator doors open Each an every one of them who has to suffer the shame and humiliation because of people like you Everyone but Jerry is now in the elevator Jerrys still addressing them Are we not human If we pick do we not bleed Elevator doors shut A few people in the hallway are looking at him he turns and addresses them I am not an animal
  Elaines office
  I did not bare myself deliberately but I tell you I wish now that I had Fred shocked by her speech flees She calls after him still standing at the hallway Because it is not me that has been exposed but you For I have seen the nipple on your soul

  Yes Couldnt you see that
  No This is why youre not in the pilot
  Well George I think youre beginning to get some perspective on things I think were making progress
  Yeah I feel like Ive grown
  Good So lets pick up on this next week
  Great They both stand Oh by the way did you get a chance to read the script
  Yes yes I did
  Well whatd you think
  Uhit wasgood
  You didnt like it
  Well no I 
  I cant believe this What was wrong with it What didnt you like about it
  It wasnt funny
  It wasnt funny What are you kidding
  No I didnt find it funny
  You didnt find it funny This is what Im paying for
  Well that whole storyline about a guy who gets into a car accident doesnt have any insurance so the judge sentences him to be a butler I didnt really buy that
  Let me tell you who did uh buy itum we pitched this story to Russell Dalrymple the president of NBC and he ate it up with a spoon
  George if youre going to be in a creative field youre going to have to learn how to deal with criticism
  Hows this for criticism Umyou stink How do like that criticism You know whats funny to me That diploma up on the wall That is my idea of commeddee You sitting here telling people what to do
  I think youd better go
  Oh Im goin baby Im goin Heads for the door then stops Its Jerrys fault He took out all my good lines Hes such a control freak
  So you send me to this therapist to help me with my emotional disorders and she criticizes our script Tosses the script to Jerry What kind of a therapist is that
  I guess she didnt think it was funny
  Oh she didnt think it was funny What is she Rowan  Martin Were supposed to meet with NBC tomorrow She completely shattered my confidence And Im paying for this shes my employee
  I thought your mothers paying for it
  And she slaves to earn every penny So that someday I might be able to walk up to a woman and say Yes Im bald but Im still a good person
  You know hes right Its not her place to criticize the script which reminds me  what did you think of it You never told me
  What did I think of it Manufactures a cough instead of answering Kramer enters
  Hey buddy I got something to tell ya Elaine runs towards to the bathroom in lieu of answering Jerrys question
  Hey one second you dont get off that easy Cmon tell me what you thought
  Well you know I
  I just kissed Gail Cunningham Jerry turns and looks at Kramer shocked Elaine grins and heads to the bathroom
  You what
  Yeah I kissed her
  You kissed her
  Right on the mouth
  What kinda great friend are you How do you go from snubbing to kissing
  Well I saw her outside the Y you know she came up to me she started yelling because I snubbed her and then we started talking a little bit and I walked her to her building And just before I left I put my arm around her waist I pulled her to me and I  mmm  I planted one Laughs
  And what did she do
  She kissed me back

  Alright The script Now Ive read this thing three timesand everytime I read itlooks nauseous struggles not to vomit
  What
  Excuse me for a second Gets up and runs to the bathroom
  What
  Would you like a PeptoBismol I keep them in my wallet Russell goes into the bathroom and shuts the door To Jerry Do you think he liked it From the bathroom we hear Russell violently heaving his guts
  Im not sure The sounds of Russell vomiting emanate from the bathroom Jerry and George sit there uncomfortably What was that dish he said he had
  Pasta primavera
  Ah You know primavera is Italian for spring
  No
  Yeah
  Really Im terribly sorry it just uhall of a sudden it just hit me
  So you were saying how umabout the script

  More jokes
  Another ending
  A different name for the butler Russell throws up again
  Maybe we should go
  We havent heard his notes yet we dont know how he feels about our work Russell throws up yet again
  Oh God Oh my god
  I cant listen to anymore of this the guys losing a lung in there Russells daughter Molly enters
  Hello
  Hi
  Hi
  Im Molly
  Oh Im Jerry
  George
  Were here discussing our script with your father
  He just read it Russell vomits again Jerry and George look ashamed
  Daddy Are you okay
  Yeah yeah sweetie Im fine Molly sits on the back of the chair
  So you live with your mother huh
  Uh yeah
  Divorce is very difficult Especially on a kid
  Uh huh
  Of course Im the result of my parents having stayed together so you never know Russell comes out of the bathroom
  Daddy are you alright Whats the matter
  Its just a stomach thing
  Yuck
  Were going to have to do this some other time so if youll give me your number Ill call you later Jerry and George nod Molly takes her jacket off
  You know suddenly Im in the mood for pasta primavera myself Jerry nudges George to sneak a peek at Mollys cleavage as she bends over and looks in her backpack Jerry has a quick look but George stares hypnotized Russell comes up behind George
  Get a good look Costanza
  What were you doing
  Well its not my fault You poked me
  Youre supposed to just take a peek after a poke You were like you just put a quarter into one of those big metal things on top of the Empire State Building
  Its cleavage I couldnt look away What am I waiting to win an Oscar here This is all I have in my life
  Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun you dont stare at it Its too risky You get a sense of it and then you look away
  All right So he caught me in a cleavage peek so big deal Who wouldnt look at his daughters cleavage Shes got nice cleavage
  Thats why I poked
  Thats why I peeked Jerry opens the door to take some trash out and meets Kramer and Gail in the hallway
  Hey What is with your friend Elaine
  What
  She comes to my restaurant comes right in my kitchen and starts complaining that Im talking about her shoes
  She did
  Right in the kitchen Disgraceful
  So I dont want people coming into my kitchen I think she might have sneezed all over someones pasta primavera Someone might have gotten sick because of her Kramer and Gail exit
  Pasta primavera
  Is that what she said Kramer pokes his head back in the door
  Shes somethin huh Shes a wild one Shes wearin me out
  She is
  Shes sensual You know with thecooking and all Kramer grins happily at Jerry and leaves The phone rings Jerry tosses the trashbag to George
  Hello Oh hi Stu
  From NBC
  to George Yeah oh the phone Whats goin on What Really Oh my goddid he give you a reasonOh boy Okay Alright Thanks hangs up Dalrymple just cancelled the pilot George drops the bag shocked
  If you hadnt gone into her restaurant this never would have happened
  Look I dont like people talking about my shoes behind my back okay My shoes are my business The two of you shouldnt have been looking at some fifteen yearolds cleavage anyway
  He poked me
  There was cleavage in the area Thats a reflex  mimics nudging someone with an elbow  cleavagepoke cleavagepoke
  But she was fifteen
  You dont consider age in the face of cleavage This occurs on a molecular level you cant control it Were like some kind of weird fish where the eyes operate independently of the head
  Alright whats the difference What are we gonna do now He wont take our calls we cant get into his office
  You know what we could do He eats at that restaurant Pfeiffers We could have Gail call us tell us the next time hes there go there and talk to him
  Hey now youre onto something
  The whole thing is so stupid Like he wouldnt do the same thing if Elaine walked by in a lowcut dress
  Yeah Well maybe not Elaine
  No
  Butsomebody like Gail though
  Ya
  What What do you mean Gail Kramer enters
  Yahhey
  Kramer listen I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor The next time Russell Dalrymple comes in the restaurant ask her if she would call me
  Alright Ill call her right now
  Ok Kramer goes back to his apartment
  What do you mean Gail You dont think I can attract attention You dont think I can put asses in the seats
  Look sweetheart you know youve got it all But lets face it Kramer comes back
  She said shell do it
  Beautiful
  Beautiful
  But she wants the shoes

  No these were the last pair of these that they had
  Ill get you another one just like it
  No but these were the only really cool ones like this Dont you see how everybody likes em and how everybody talks about em Jerry realizing Elaines motivation sits at the counter unbelievingly
  Elaine this pilotit doesnt matter to me its not me Im concerned aboutits my mother Ive been over to the hospital to see her
  Oh yeah because she caught you jer 
  Never mind
  Oh come on wait a second this whole thing is ridiculous How do I even know she wears the same size

  Hey Whattaya know
  Look whos here
  Fancy meeting you here
  Oh Hello
  Pasta primavera Back on the horse
  You know its a funny thing because after the pilot got cancelled we hadnt heard from you
  Didnt hear anything
  Didnt knowwe were wonderingwhat happened
  Well it just didnt seem to be the right project for us right now Elaine walks by in a lowcut dress Jerry and George look at her as she moves to the table opposite Russell So what were you saying
  Ohuh because if it had anything at all to do with what you perceived as me leering at your daughter I really have to take issue with that I did not leer To Jerry Did I leer
  No leer Elaine comes over to Russells table
  Uh excuse me are you using that ketchup
  Uh no Elaine takes the ketchup and goes back to her table
  Because if Im looking straight ahead and something enters my field of vision thats merely a happenstance Elaine loudly snaps and unfolds her napkin at the next table to get Russells attention
  Under the circumstances I dont really feel that we should be in business together Elaine comes back over
  Heres your ketchup back You know I had the hardest time trying to get some out I mean I just kept pounding and pounding on the bottom of it Do you have any trouble
  No
  Do you have aketchup secret
  No I finally notices Elainedont have a ketchup secret Smiles
  Because if you do have a ketchup secret I would really really like to know what it is Russell is pleased and smiles at Elaine Elaine goes back to her table sits down and waves at Russell
  Field of vision huh
  Hows everything
  Mmmm
  Really good
  This pasta primavera is fabulous
  Very tasty
  Howd everything go with that NBC guy
  Great
  The pilots back on In fact Elaines going out with him tomorrow night Gail nods and walks away Listen Elaine you know if Russell mentions anything about the pilot youll of course tell him how much you liked it
  You know I happen to have the script right here with me and uhon page 3 for example suppose the Elaine character comes in wearing aa lowcut dress And the butler is very distracted and cant work
  Uhthat kind of comedy thats a little broad for us
  Well Im sure its right up Russells alley
  Well its a funny idea
  Its funny
  Cmon funny is funny
  Funny is funny were here to entertain right
  Alright well maybe Ill mention it to Russell tomorrow night
  If you can
  Yeah Wheres he taking you by the way
  Bouchards on 53rd George starts choking on his wine and attempts to tell Elaine something
  I think what hes trying to say is get the bouillabase George nods yes and continues to choke
  I dont want to live I dont want to live
  Because of me You must be joking Who wouldnt want to live because of me Im nothing
  No Youre something

  Look you made the allegation The least you could do is follow up
  Jerry what am I gonna do Im gonna go in there and spy on her in the sauna
  Yes Go in there Do a little investigative journalism I need to know
  But a few more dates and you can find out for yourself
  Dont be so sure Look at George  hes on his ninth date with Betsy he still hasnt gotten anywhere with her
  Whats his problem

  He cant go left
  No Im lefty cant go right What about women Do they go left or right

  So whens the funeral Well Aunt Clarice was so ill I guess it was really a blessing George on the couch behind Betsy is impatiently waiting for her to get off the phone so he can continue putting the moves on her He shrugs and crosses himself Yeah Ill fly home as soon as I can George waves goodbye and mimics a plane flying through the air with his hand Ok You too Get some sleep Betsy looks at George and he manufactures a completely phony look of sorrow
  Youre sure

  Im not giving you the satisfaction Im gonna watch it again
  So this morning I go down to the garage to check the car out I figure by this time the odour molecules have had at least twelve hours to desmellify I open the car door like a punch in the face the stench hits me its almost as if it had gained strength throughout the night
  Yknow I can think of at least six known offensive odours that I would rather smell than whats livin in your car
  What about skunk
  I dont mind skunk
  Horse manure
  I loooove horse manure
  Well Ive never seen anything like this in my life In fact I went to the car wash they want 250 dollars to detail it and get the smell out Im not payin for that Thats not my responsibility In fact Im drivin up to that restaurant now and demand they pay for it
  Absolutely
  Listen lemme ask you something When youre with a guy and he tells you he has to get up early what does that mean
  It means hes lying
  Wow
  Why Is that what he told you
  Yeah last night Oh come on Men have to get up early some time
  No Never
  Jerry Im sure Ive seen men on the street early in the morning
  Well sometimes we do actually have to get up early but a man will always trade sleep for sex
  Is it possible Im not as attractive as I think I am
  Anythings possible
  Whats the matter with you
  Steinbrenner Hes ruinin my life
  Oh yeah Steinbrenner
  I dont think I can take another season with him Jerry Hell just trade away their best young prospects just like he did with Beuner McGee Drabek McGriff
  I know the list
  Whats that smell
  What smell
  Ooooh You stink
  Whatdya mean I stink
  You stink Why dont you go take a shower
  I showered Oh wait a second Since I showered Ive been in the car
  So
  Dont you see whats happening here Its attached itself to me Its alive
  If it attached itself to you then Oh my God Thats why Carl said he had to get up early Because I stink Jerry he thinks I have BO Me
  What happened
  What happened My car stinks is what happened And its destroying the lives of everyone in its path
  What is that BO
  Yeah
  This is unbelievable BO
  I know I was at the car wash this morning and the guy told me in his 38 years in the business hes never smelled anything like it
  So let me ask you Do you think I could have done this
  No no Its the valet guy
  No no I mean driving Susan to lesbianism
  Oh No thats ridiculous
  What if her experience with me drove her to it
  Suicide maybe not lesbianism
  The woman shes lesbianing with Susan told me shes never been with a guy
  Oh this isnt even BO This is beyond BO Its BBO
  There should be a BO squad that patrols the city like a Smell Gestapo To sniff em out strip em down and wash them with a big soapy brush
  Yknow the funny thing is somehow I find her more appealing now Its like if I knew she was a lesbian when we went out I never wouldve broken up with her
  Lemme see if I understand this On second thought
  Here he is thats the guy rolls up window No thank you go back go back Ill park it You go back
  What do you mean stunk up
  I mean the car stinks George does the car stink
  Stinks
  Stinks
  Well perhaps youre the one who has the odour
  Hey Ive never smelled in my life buddy
  Really Well I smell you now
  Thats from the car
  Well maybe youre the one who stunk up the car rather than the car stinking up you
  Oh its the chicken and the egg
  Thank you very much Well then go out and smell the car see which smells worse
  I dont have time to smell cars
  Forget about smelling the car Smell the valet Go to the source
  Youve gotta smell the car
  Im a busy man
  Cmon One whiff
  Alright one whiff
  Alright I give up I admit it It stinks Now will you let me out
  Alright will you pay for the cleaning
  Yes 50 dollars Ill give you 50 dollars
  Im not paying for that Theyve already got my seven dollars sarcastically erotic journey from Milan to Minsk
  The valet had such bad BO
  Oh man just rampant mutant BO The O went from the valets B to the car to me It clings to everything Jerry thinks its an entity But I showered and I shampooed so
  Thats a relief
  What
  Its still there
  No no no It cant be I shampooed I rinsed I repeated
  Listen I gotta ask you I was a little concerned that perhaps I was responsible in some way for your uh metamorphosis
  Thatll be 9800
  What 9800
  Thats what I said 9800
  How could that piece of crap cost 9800
  So was it me
  Oh dont be ridiculous Is that what you wanted to talk to me about Gives him the 35 Here
  Oh thanks Thanks a lot Ill pay you back
  Yeah sure I gotta go
  Listen Let me ask you something If you and Mona were ever to dance how do you decide who leads I mean do you take turns Do you discuss it beforehand How does that work
  Youre an idiot
  Why Thats a legitimate sociological question
  Ill see ya And George by the way You stink Real bad
  Its not me Its the car
  I didnt think Id come
  I knew you would
  Oh Kramer
  We spray everything with OziumD let it deionise vacuum the spray out with a deionising machine Hit it with highpressure compressed air and wetdry vac it to extract the remaining liquids We top it off with one of our seven airfresheners in your case I would recommend the Jasmine or the Potpourri
  Lets do it
  The first thing were gonna do is flush the follicles with the five essential oils Then we put you under a vapour machine and then a heated cap Then we shampoo and shampoo and condition and condition Then we saturate the hair in diluted vinegar two parts vinegar 10 parts water Now if that doesnt work we have one last resort Tomato sauce
  Tomato Sauce
  Wait a minute It still smells It still smells
  It still smells
  It still smells
  How could it still smell after all that
  I dont know
  Well what are you gonna do
  Ill tell you what Im gonna do Im selling that car
  Youre selling the car
  You dont understand what Im up against This is a force more powerful than anything you can imagine Even Superman would be helpless against this kind of stench And Ill take anything I can get for it
  Maybe Ill buy it
  Are you crazy Dont you understand what Im saying to you This is not just an odour you need a priest to get rid of this thing
  I still smell
  You see You see what Im saying to you Its a presence Its the beast
  Kramer Kramer Kramer open up I know youre in there

  Sauce me
  I have a friend who is about to get married theyre having the bachelor party and the bridal shower on the same day So its conceivable that while shes getting the lingerie hed be at a nude bar watching a table dancer wearing the same outfit That is possible But to me the difference between being single and being married is the form of government You see when youre single you are the dictator of your own life I have complete power I can give the order to fall asleep on the sofa with the TV on in the middle of the day noone can overrule me When youre married youre part of a vast decisionmaking body Before anything gets done there are meetings Committees have to study the situation And this is if the marriage works Thats whats so painful about divorce you get impeached and youre not even the president

  Whats going on here How is that possible
  Do you think its a coincidence
  No I havent seen four women like this together outside of a Russ Meyer film
  to the waitress Hi Excuse me Who does all the hiring waitresses here
  He does pointing to the manager Mr Visaki In fact were looking for another girl if you know anyone she walks away
  You know what Thats discriminatory That is unfair Why should these women have all the advantages Its not enough they get all the attention from men they have to get all the waitress jobs too

  A photographers studio
  Ive never seen hands like these before
  Theyre so soft and milky white
  You know whos hands they remind me of Pauses for effect Ray McKigney
  Ugh Ray
  He was it
  Who was he
  The most exquisite hands youve ever seen Oh he had it all
  Hands still out even though theyve stopped looking at them What happened to him
  Clears throat Tragic story Im afraid He couldve had any woman in the world but none could match the beauty of his own hand and that became his one true love
  You mean uh
  Yes he was not master of his domain
  Makes a gesture saying he understands The man nods But how uh
  Quick to the point The muscles became so strained with overuse that eventually the hand locked into a deformed position and he was left with nothing but a claw Holds hand up displaying a clawlike shape He traveled the world seeking a cure acupuncturists herbalists swamis nothing helped Towards the end his hands became so frozen the was unable to manipulate utensils Visibly disgusted by this last part and was dependent on Cub Scouts to feed him I hadnt seen another pair of hands like Ray McKigneys until today You are his successor George looks down at his hands I uh only hope you have a little more selfcontrol
  Smiling to himself You dont have to worry about me Nodding gloating I won a contest
  Ok lets get to work

  No you
  Ya
  Whatd you think

  Ah youre screwed
  I know swan dives from twenty floors up lands right on top What do I got a bulls eye up there He couldnt move over two feet Land on the sidewalk Its city property

  YEA
  Whats the matter
  Are you alright
  Dont even question my instincts because my instincts are honed REPAPER Look at that
  What now
  Look look
  Kramer shows Jerry and Elaine the paper Hospital receives grant to conduct DNA research Government funds genetic research at area hospital  Yeah so
  pigman baby pigman
  If I hear about this pigman one more time
  Hey Im tellin ya the pigman is alive The government has been experimenting with pigmen since the fifties
  Oh will you stop it Just because a hospital studying DNA research doesnt mean theyre creating a race of mutant pigmen
  Jerry wake up to reality Its a military thing Theyre probably creating a whole army of pig warriors
  I tell you something I wish there were pigmen You get a few of these pigmen walking around suddenly Im looking a whole lot better Then if somebody wants to fix me up at least they could say Hey hes no pigman
  Believe me thered be plenty of women going for these pigmen Whatever the deformity is theres always some group of perverts thats attracted to it Oo that little tail really turns me on
  MUMBLES Thats just about enough
  Oh whats the matter this doesnt interest you
  Oh no its fascinating but could you do me a favor could ya tape the rest of the pigmen and the women who love them discussion and Ill listen to it the next time Im here Ive gotta go find a Mohel
  You know you should call this off Elaine Its a barbaric ritual
  Well perhaps one day when the pigmen roam free it will be stopped Kramer Until then off with their heads
  But Kramer isnt it a question of hygiene
  Its a myth Besides it makes sex more pleasurable
  Yeah So how does that help me
  TO GEORGE Hey George you ever see one
  Yeah my roommate in college
  So whatd you think
  thinks for a second I got used to it
  Alright Im waiting II want to see the pigman Show me the pig man
  Oh dont worry Im gonna show you and youll never be the same
  Maybe hes just a guy with a nose like this holds his nose up like a pig You know a lot of people have a nose like this theyre not necessarily pigmen
  Believe me Jerry somewhere in this hospital the anguished oink of pigman cries out for help
  Well if I hear an anguished oink Im outta here II dont see any pigmen Look HE POINTS AT PASSERBY Human human human HE LOOKS DOWN CORRIDOR WITH ALARM WITH MOCK ALARM Wait a second Grabs Kramer
  What
  Oh its George
  Alright the administrators on the third floor Ill meet you guys back at the car
  Wait wait George You got room in the car for the pigman huh
  The pigman can take the bus
  George if the pigman had a car he would give you a ride
  How do you know What if pigman had a twoseater
  Be realistic George
  Ill tell you what if pigman shows up well squeeze him in Ill see you later
  Yea
  Mr Costanza come in come in Its been a very trying couple of days around the hospital Doctors patients everyone just grief stricken over this unfortunate occurrence
  Well I join them in their grief
  Horrible thing Flew right past the childrens wing All the sick children in the playroom looking out the window just traumatized by the incident Apparently they thought he was flying You know how children are Oh look A man is flying A man is flying And then splat
  Thats where I come in Umm on splat Uh you see Mrs Sweedler or is it hospital administrator Sweedler
  Mrs Sweedlers fine
  Mrs Sweedler thank you YYou see this tragedy affected me in a very very personal way
  How is that
  Yes well you see the deceased landed on my car The uh splat as it were actually occurred on the roof of my car Now of course I cant help but feel that had it been a convertible this whole tragedy might have been averted but Ive never been the kind of guy to buy a convertible what with the baldness and everything
  Well I have known bald men who owned convertibles They wore a hat
  Yes but then everything is all pulled down and its jus Anyway The damage unfortunately has marred an otherwise fine automobile rendering it virtually undriveable
  STIFFENING Yes well that is a shame
  Yes a shame That is exactly how I would put it Now Mrs Sweedler with all due discretion and sensitivity and taking in the whole scope of the situation I just cant help but think that the hospital is somehow responsible for compensating the other still living victim of horrendous horrendous tragedy
  MrConstanza
  Yes
  A man plummeted tragically to his ultimate demise 
  Yes
   and you greedily callously want to profit from it
  PULLING OUT ESTIMATE OUT OF HIS POCKET Well profit I think youll see from the estimate that Im not really profiting that much They might be a little high but
  Get out Get out now Get out of my office
  Should I leave this
  GET OUT
  Excuse me What happened to the man that was in this room before
  I dont know what youre talking about
