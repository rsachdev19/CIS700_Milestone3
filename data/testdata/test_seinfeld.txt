What was his name?
His name? Name, um, his name was uh, uh, Eduardo Carochio.
Pass the salt please.
Where did you meet him?
Um, actually, I met him in Switzerland, and he was fighting uh, is that the word they use? Fighting? Because they don't really fight the bull, they avoid fighting the bull.
Bread.
I just love meeting new people. You know that's how you really do learn about life.
God bless you.
Thank you.
I wasn't going to say anything, but then I could see that he wasn't going to open his mouth. (Chuckles)
You know who's a good actor? Anthony Quinn.
Oh, Anthony Quinn, fine actor. But from what I understand, not a very good driver. Hits everything on the road. But always leaves a note.
Did you ever see Zorba the Greek?
Excellent film. In fact Quinn said he never felt so good as when he left a note after smacking into a car.
Come here. (moves in for a kiss)
Really, I was, I was only kidding around.
He was only joking Michael.
You think you're so damn special because you say 'God bless you'?
No, no, I don't think I'm special. My mother always said I'm not special.
He was only joking Michael! Sorry.
All right! Take his side!
I am not taking his side.
Well who's side are you taking?!
Well I'm not taking your side!
Kirk Douglas. Now there's another very bad driver. But he's such an unbelievable guy, that when he hits someone, he doesn't even leave a note. He sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up so he can exchange license, registration, and apologize.
I said 'God bless you'. Was that so wrong?
The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his 'God bless you'? Because as the husband, he has the right to first refusal.
It's me.
Come on up.
Yes, yes, I definitely waited. But let me say this Once he passes on that option, that 'God bless you' is up for grabs.
No argument. Unless, she's one of these multiple sneezers, and he's holding his 'God bless you' in abeyance, until she completes the series.
Well I don't think she is a multiple sneezer, because she sneezed again later, and it was also a single.
What if she's having an off night?
Hi!
Hi.
Well! If it isn't mister gesuntheit!
Oh ya, like there's something wrong with saying 'God bless you'. I was raised to say 'God bless you'.
Ah, shut up.
What does it mean anyway? 'God bless you'. It's a stupid 'stuperstition'.
A stupid what?
Whatever.
You know, if you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze, you shouldn't say 'God bless you', you should say, 'You're soo good lookin''.
Yeah, yeah, that's better than 'God bless you'. Anyway, she left a message on my machine, she wants you to call her.
Who?
Robin!
Why?!
Well I assumed she called to apologize, that's why she called me.
Entertainment Tonight's on.
Where's the remote phone?
Bedroom.
Hey, grab Jerry's sweater for me, would you?
What's it like out?
Chilly out.
Can I take a sweater?
Yeah, you can take a sweater if you want to.
Scarf?
Nah, hey, shut this off, shut it off.
What's the matter? What's going on?
What happened?!
What?
I think I hit my head again!
What is wrong?!
Hey, hey, wait a minute! Let me ask you something. Kramer, the last time you hit your head, was Mary Hart on TV?
Yeah.
That is it!
What?
That is it! Mary Hart's voice, don't you see? There's something about Mary Hart's voice that's giving you seizures. Just like, just like, just like that woman in Albany!
Mary Hart!
God.
What?
Well she apologized, and then she wanted to know if we could get together Wednesday afternoon.
Get together?
Maybe she just wants to talk to me?
Married women don't 'get together'. They have affairs.
Oh my God, an affair. That's so adult. It's like with stockings and martinis, and William Holden. On the other hand it probably wouldn't cost me any money.
Are you actually considering this?
I can't have an affair with a married woman, that's despicable!
Yeah, it's like hitting a car and driving away without leaving a note.
Yeah.
Hey, you know who owns that car?
What car?
The one that was hit a couple of nights ago.
Yeah who?
That blond across the street. You know the one with the long ponytail, she wears those blue sweatpants.
The blond with the blue sweatpants! Yeah, I think I've seen her.
Well I've got to get going. I'm meeting a guy with grey sweatpants.
Wait, wait, wait, how do you know it's not John Tesh?
The blond with the blue sweatpants!
Well, who is she?
I've had a crush on this woman for year! I've always been afraid to approach her! She looks like she belongs on one of these Hallmark cards.
Oh right, right! The blue sweatpants! Gees, it's too bad you can't say anything because of Angela.
Oh yeah. Too bad. Angela. Lousy thug. I mean what kind of sick person does something like that? That woman belongs in prison! I mean, I actually owe it to society to do something about this! I can't sit by and allow this to go on. It's a moral issue is what it is!
You can't compromise your principles!
How am I going to live with myself?!
Can't live!
I'm not religious, but I certainly know where to draw the line!
This country needs more people like you!
Don't sell yourself short saying 'God bless you' to every Tom, Dick and Harry in great personal risk.
I believe strongly in that as you know.
There should be more people like us.
That's why the world's in the shape it's in.
You're telling me.
Anyway, I just wanted you to know, that I'm going to do everything I can to make sure the party responsible is made to be responsible or something very close to that.
Well God bless you.
Thank you very much.
Oh my God. I must be crazy. What have I done?
Oh no, what's wrong?
What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong. I just committed adultery!
You didn't commit adultery, I did.
Oh yeah.
If I didn't do it with you, I would have done it with someone else.
Well, I wouldn't want you to do that. You know there's a lot of losers out there.
Maybe even someone who didn't say 'God bless you'.
Well, that's a given.
In three years with Michael, not one 'God bless you'.
Must be hell living in that house.
Hi, it's Michael.
Hi, Michael!
Is Robin there?
Robin? No, why?
Uh, she said she was going to be with you.
No I haven't spoken to her all day-uh, yeah right, um, as a matter of fact, um, she was here, and she uh, left a note, but I wasn't here, but I have the note, uh, right here.
If she's not with you, then where is she?
Well I, I don't know.
Is she with your bald friend from the other night?!
No, no, come on Michael!
He's finished! I'm going to sew his ass to his face! I'm going to twist his neck so hard his lips will be his eyebrows! I'm going to break his joints, and reattach them!
You're soo good lookin'.
Now you listen to me, suck face! You tell anybody, anything, and I will carve my initials in your brain tissue!
Let me rephra-
I'll bash your skull into a vegematic like a bad cabbage, and I'll have a party on your head!
Hi Elaine, this is Angela.
I'll pluck all your body hairs out with my teeth!
Well I think I get the gist of it.
So you don't say anything to anybody about me hitting that car!
What car?
Good. I'm glad we understand each other.
It's not complicated.
Very nice meeting you!
Come on up.
Well, well, well, Mr. Seinfeld! That must have been so frightening! When you confronted that guy, in Queens! Now, let's just see if I've got this scenario right.
Alright Elaine.
No, no, no, no, no. Because I'm picturing 'French Connection', kind of thing. You know? Sort of a Popeye Doyle chase through the city!
It was just a couple of blocks.
Oh no, no, come on. Don't be so modest!
Hey.
Oh, did you check you machine?
No, why, what's happening?
Michael called me today, and he asked me where Robin was.
Yeah, okay.
And I said I hadn't seen her.
What?!
No, no George! You don't understand! She didn't tell me she was using me as an excuse! Okay?! But then I realized what was going on, and I said that she left a note. Um, but he didn't really buy that. And then, and then he did mention your name.
He mentioned my name?! What did he say?!
He said he was going to sew your ass to your face.
What? Why couldn't you think of something?!
Well I don't know, he caught me off guard!
You lie! How hard is it to lie?!
It's not that hard.
Well who told you to sleep with her George?!
It's not my fault! I wasn't going to do anything until you got her all juiced up with your story about having the affair with the matador!
Oh Gosh! None of this would never have happened if you wouldn't have said 'God bless you'!
Oh don't-
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it people! Matador? What matador?
She told this couple she had an affair with a matador.
A matador! Well, well, well. Uno momento por favor. Pray tell, what was the young man's name?
Uh, Eduardo, uh, Carochio.
Eduardo, Carochio! That's good. That's very good. Kind of just rolls of the tongue. I wonder where on the upper west side a single girl might meet a matador? Perhaps Zabars? Or Les Pizza!
Anyway, this person told me to tell you to get an estimate on the damage.
Well, I already got an estimate. It's $875.
$875?
That's right.
Uh, well, I'll tell you what. Um, I'll give you a check, and then this person can pay me back.
Um, who do I make it out to?
Becky Gelke. G-E-L-K-E.
So, what are you doing this weekend?
You have got some nerve! You smash up my car, you don't admit it, and now you want to ask me out on a date?
I didn't do it!
Yeah righ-
You are soo good lookin'.
Thank you.
Jerry, let's go! You ready?
You sure you want to do this? I'm going to be on the road for three weeks!
Excuse me, I've got a maniac stalking me, I'm not staying in the city.
Alright!
Come on let's get out of here.
How could you?
What?!
Man! I never thought you were capable of this!
What did I do?
I just talked to Becky Gelke outside, she told me how you hit and ran.
I-
I don't even want to look at you anymore! All these years of friendship and you're nothing but a felon. You're an embarrassment to the building.
I didn't do it! I just had to pay her to cover for somebody else!
Now you're not going to lie to me, are you?
No, never.
Alright. Well. Glad we got that straightened out because I've got a date with her.
You got a date with Becky Gelke?!
Yeah, going out with her Saturday night.
Jerry, can we get out of here?!
As a matter of fact, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have even had an excuse to talk to her.
Well I'm happy to help, in any way that I can.
(laughing) Kramer, would you hold still? I cant do this if you keep moving.
You sure you dont want me to take my clothes off? (beat) Ill do it!
No, thats the last thing in the world I want you to do.
Well, why dont you take your clothes off?
I dont know... I dont think Jerry would like that.
(debonair smile) Well, itd be our little secret.
Jerrys apartment]
(bursting out of the bathroom, fumbling with his fly) Button fly! Why do they put buttons on a fly? It takes ten minutes to get these things open!
I like the button fly.
(incredulous) What?
That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking metal teeth. Its like a mink trap down there. (beat) What are you doing today?
Nothing.
I have to go meet Nina. Want to come up to her lot, check out her paintings?
I dont get art.
Theres nothing to get.
Well, it always has to be explained to me, and then I have to have someone explain the explanation.
She does a lot of abstract stuff. In fact she's painting Kramer right now.
What for?
She sees something in him.
So do I, but I wouldn't hang it on a wall.
Nina's studio again--same scene]
Are you getting the eyes? 'Cause they're brown. (beat) Or, really, they're dark brown, like rich, Columbian coffee.
Tell me about Elaine.
She and Jerry were a big thing, like Abe Lincoln and Mary Todd.
But, they're still friends.
Oh yeah, they're like this (holds up two fingers together).
Don't you think that's strange?
Why, what's the difference?
Well, are you still friends with any of your ex-girlfriends?
Well, you know... I, uh... have many relationships.
the door outside Nina's studio]
You know, I'm a little nervous.
Why?
Well, you know... the friend meeting the new woman. I feel like I'm getting fixed up for a friendship.
I don't know how long this is gonna last.
Really? I thought you liked her.
I do... she's got like a jealousy thing. She doesn't like me having fun with anyone but her. (knocks on the door)
You know, it's a miracle you're not married. (beat) Hey, I'm not obligated to buy anything, am I?
Hi, Nina. (smooch) This is my friend George.
How nice to meet you, I've heard a lot about you. (George nods)
(walking over to where Kramer is posing) Hey, look at this guy!
Yeah!
(to Nina) I brought George up to see some of your paintings.
Oh, are you interested?
(looking uncomfortable) Um... yeah! Sure, sure I'm interested.
George, you gonna buy a painting?
(gritting teeth) Yeah, sure.
Are you an art-lover?
I am an art-adorer! I adore art.
Great! Well, take a look around. Pick out something you like. (George reluctantly begins to look around, while Jerry strolls over to the painting-in-progress [Kramer] and picks up a brush.)
May I? (pantomimes making a big "X" across the painting)
(laughing) Get outta here! (beat) Here, play with this. (hands Jerry a small white envelope)
What's this?
My father gave me four tickets to the Yankee game for Saturday afternoon. Owner's box, first row behind the dugout.
(sincerely disappointed) Oh, Saturday... I'm working, I'm going out of town.
Oh, well. I'm not gonna go without you. Do you guys want 'em?
(immediately) Yeah.
They're right behind the dugout, George, first row!
Behind the dugout, are you kidding? How did you get them?
Oh, my father's the Yankees accountant... it's the owner's box.
All my life I've dreamed of sitting front row, behind the dugout!
(gesturing towards a small, ugly painting George was apparently look-ing at and happens to be holding) You like that one?
Saturday, the game. George, Kramer, and Elaine are being lead to their seats]
Look at where we are! (referring to the seat usher) He's not stopping! He just keeps going and going and going! (the usher abruptly stops at the second row) We're not in the first row?
No, no, these are your seats.
She said first row! Right behind the dugout!
Well, it's the second row. It's just as good.
I was all primed for the first row; I was gonna put my feet up on the dugout!
Would you shut up? These are great! You can't get any better than this.
Oh, there's better, (pointing at the row in front of them) right there, that's better.
Right. (Elaine giggles) Oh boy... okay, who wants a dog? (Kramer hands out the hot dogs)What a great day!
I could've been at my boss' son's bris right now.
(amused) You're supposed to do that?
(shrugs) Yeah. (beat) What makes you think anyone would want to go to a circumcision?
I'd rather go to a hanging.
Anyway, I called him back... I told him I had to go visit my father in the hospital in Maryland. (George laughs)
(screaming at the players on the field) YOU BETTER CATCH IT,
George?
Yeah?
Hi. I'm Leonard West, Nina's father.
Hi! Mr. West, this is my friend Elaine--
Hi!
(screaming again) HEY, 230 AIN'T GONNA CUT IT IN THIS TOWN, BABE!
#NAME?
Oh, hey.
So how are the seats?
Okay.
Great, great.
Yeah.
George, I heard you bought one of Nina's paintings.
Yeah, it's being framed right now. I don't even know what it costs. (beat) Not, uh, too expensive, is it?
Well, if you have a lot of money.
(leaving) Well, enjoy the game. (beat -- to Elaine) I think you better take off that Orioles cap.
(thinking he's joking) Yeah. I better!
No, no, no. Seriously. You're in the owner's box, and I don't think it's a good idea.
You're not serious.
Yes, yes, yes, I am!
Well, did he say that?
No, no, but he gave me the seats. I don't think he'd like it if you wore an Orioles cap.
Well maybe you should ask him!
I don't have to ask him! Now are you gonna take the hat off or not?
No! I don't have to take it off, why should I take it off? This is ridiculous!!
Just take the cap off.
George, we are at a baseball game! This is America!
Look. Either you take the cap off, or you'll have to leave.
Well, I don't care, I'm not taking it off.
Just take the cap off!
No!
Hey! Just wait a minute. We just got here!
(to Elaine) Do you want us to go with you?
(getting up) I'll go get your hat, George.
(sarcastically, to George) Stay!
Okay, we'll go!
the ball knocks him squarely in the head, he falls off the dugout onto the crowd)
...and then the ball hits him in the head and he falls right over the railing!
Is he okay?
Well, yeah, he's fine! We took him to the emergency room, and you know, the x-rays were all negative. (beat) It was quite a day!
This is the most amazing story I've ever heard--why did he want you to take off the baseball cap? That is so insane!
I know! Can you imagine that?
How you feeling?
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (beat--holds up newspaper) Hey, we made the paper. Eh? Look at this- page 2, sports section... we're all in the picture.
Wha- a picture?
A picture.
OUR PICTURE'S IN THERE??
Uh-huh.
(gasps) I cannot believe this!
(pointing) There's George!
Yup, yup!
Ohmygod! Lippman could see this! He thinks I was visiting my father! Oh my g-I make up one little white lie and they put my picture in the paper!
Lippman's office. Lippman is at his desk, Elaine enters.]
Hi, Mr. Lippman.
How's your father?
My, my father?
Yeah. You, you went to see him, right?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
I went to visit him.
Uh-huh. So, what was wrong with him?
Well, you name it, uh, neuritis, uh, neuralgia...
But--but he's feeling better now?
Um, yup. Yes, yes, it just... such a miracle, um. My visit must have buoyed (Elaine says "boyed") his spirits.
(correcting her) Boo-eed.
What--what did I say?
You said "boyed."
I did?
Yeah.
Well, I got a plane to catch.
Oh! Where are you going?
Going to Houston. It's a publisher's convention. (beat) Can I have my sports section?
Ah. ...Yeah.
I've been saving it for the plane. I never miss the Sunday sports section.
There's nothing to read, it's just yesterday's news. You know, the Yankees won, the Mets lost, Ricky Henderson's unhappy...
Right, right. (starts to take the paper from Elaine's hand; Elaine holds on tight.) What, what are you doing?
Wha-- oh! (noticing her hand) Oh, god! (laughs) That is the THIRD time today I have done that! BLAAAH! (laughs again) Grabbing news- papers... I'm just tugging at 'em... (laughs)
Gotta go.
Okay! Well, you know, have a nice trip, and uh... alrighty! (beat) I'll just hold down the, uh, fort!
Nina's studio. Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong are admiring Nina's "Kramer."]
I sense great vulcrability. A land child crying out for love, an innocent orphan in the post-modern world.
I see a parasite.
A sexually-depraved miscrient, who is seeking to gratify only his most basic and immediate urges.
Another part of the studio where Jerry and Nina are arguing.]
She was a guest of my father's. She should've taken the cap off.
It's preposterous! They ask someone to take off a baseball cap at a baseball game. (beat) How can you defend that?
Armstrongs admiring painting again.]
He is struggled, he is man-struggled. He lifts my spirit!
He is a loathsome, offensive brute, yet I can't look away.
Jerry and Nina again.]
Look, I'm really getting tired off all the fighting. Maybe we should just end this before we really start hating each other.
Oh, well, you wouldn't want that because you always have to remain friends!
Well, I like to remain friends with people I was friends with!
Hey -- why don't you just go then! And -- oh, give this to George. Tell him he owes me $500!
Armstrongs]
He transcends time and space.
He sickens me.
I love it.
Me too.
Jerry's apartment.]
Five-hundred dollars?! What?
That's what she told me!
I'm not paying $500 for this! It's a piece of junk!
That's what it costs!
Why did you even take it? You broke up with her!
I wasn't thinking! I don't know.
You weren't thinking.
Well, she framed it and everything.
Well, I'm not buying it. No way. Forget it. No way I'm buying this! (beat) I mean, look at it! What is it? It's a bunch of squiggly lines! (beat) Are you telling me you couldn't paint this?
Do you want me to paint you something? I'd love to paint you some- thing!
I'm not paying for this. If you were going out with her, it'd be a different story.
(entering, handing Jerry a piece of paper) This was in front of your door.
Hey, Kramer.
Hi, Mike.
(looking at the paper) Wow, a letter from Nina!
(notices the painting) Whoa, man! That is the ugliest thing I've ever seen!
(reading note) Oh my god!
What?
This is amazing, you can't believe this!
What's it say?
Listen to this "I don't know what you expect to find out there, Jerry, you know what you want better than me. But there's one thing I do know. I know I can stand here watching you destroy everything I've ever wanted in my life, wanting to smash your face with my fists, because you won't make even the slightest effort to offer happiness and still know that I love you. You mean so much to me that I'm will-ing to take all your abuse and insults and insensitivity."
WOW!
(emotionally) She's deep.
(reading on) "...'cause that's what you need to do to prove I'm not going to leave you. I'm sick and tired of running from places and people and relationships. You want me, that fight for me, becau-"
You know Jerry, she sounds like a poet!
No one's ever written me a letter like this. Maybe I was wrong about her!
(pushing Jerry towards the phone) Yeah! Get in there and give her a call. Pick up the phone and call her!
Should I?
(screaming) YES! YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT YOU SHOULD! (hysterically) Fight for her, Jerry, she's sure as hell fighting for you!
ALL RIGHT, all right! I'll call her.
Jerry's apartment, another day. Jerry is helping Nina put on her coat. The TV is on a horse race.]
SHOT! (the sound of a shot on the TV is heard) I told ya! (the inter- com buzzes) Yeah?
(on intercom) It's George.
Come on up. (to Nina) Well, now we gotta get a posse together. I love a good posse.
What's the appeal of the posse?
The appeal of the posse? The posse has tremendous appeal. Get away from the job, camp out, you're with your friends... Come on, it's a week-long game of hide-and-seek on horseback.
Hello, George.
Hey, Nina! (beat) I owe you some money, don't I?
Well, I really love that piece.
Oh, yeah, me too, me too. Boy oh boy oh boy...! You know, in fact, I've been thinking about it, and I feel like I'm stealing from you! Five-hundred dollars! It's gonna be worth thousands soon! You know what? On second thought, I can't even accept it.
No, no no no, George! A deal's a deal. I want you to have it!
This could be in a museum some day! It's not safe with me! It should really be in a doormanned building.
Honestly, George, the money's not important.
Who said anything about money? (intercom buzzes)
Yeah?
(on intercom) It's Elaine.
Come on up.
Elaine?
...Yeah.
(rolling eyes) This person does not believe in telephones, does she?
She likes the pop-in. I've told her how I hate the pop-in. (pointing to George) He likes the pop-in, too.
I just popped in now. I'm a big pop-in guy.
Yeah.
How 'bout Kramer.
HUGE pop-in guy!
Well, I was leaving anyway, so, uh, we're on for tomorrow?
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay!
Bye. (just as Nina is about to leave, Elaine walks in.)
(to Nina) Hello!
(sarcastic) Chatty gal. (beat) Lippman's coming back tomorrow, I'll be fired!
If he noticed, he would have called you from Houston!
No, he wants to torture me.
later on that night. George, Elaine, and Jerry are watching TV.Jerry, with the remote, is furiously flipping through channels.]
(annoyed) Oh! Would you gimme the clicker? I hate it when you're the clicker! You go too fast! (Elain makes a grab for the clicker, instigating a tug-o-war between Elaine and Jerry over the clicker)
(tugging at the clicker) I'm a great clicker! (gets the clicker back) Great instincts. How dare you impune my clicking.
You're all over the dial! You don't know what you want! I've never seen you stay on anything for more than 5 seconds. Gimme that.
Let go!
No, come on! I want it, Jerry!
Let go, Elaine!
Well at least let George do it!
Oh, George can't click! (George joins in the fight)
(as Jerry and Elaine continue to whine) Give it! Give it! (he finally gets the remote away from them) Pinheads.
Wait, wait a second! Go back, go back to that. (they watch it a little longer)
It's Chapter 2, it's Neil Simon.
(on to something) Wait a second... wait a second!! (he watches the TV for another minute) The letter, that's the letter!
What letter?
This is the letter she wrote to me, she stole it right from the movie!
"...'cause you don't even make the slightest effort to offer happiness still know that I love you!!"
This is incredible!
I always thought there was something funny about this letter! She copied it right out of Chapter 2! She a thief, a bunko-artist!
Maybe I won't send her that check.
You know, it's not really that terrible.
What are you talking about? She completely misrepresented herself! (mimicking the letter) I don't offer happiness. I offer happiness! James Caan doesn't offer happiness!
Lippman's office. Lippman is on the phone when Elaine walks in and places something on his desk. After she does, she tries to leave but Lippman, still on the phone, motions for her to stay in the room]
(into phone)...yeah, yeah. But she wouldn't take the cap off? (beat) But didn't she know they were the owner's seats? (beat) Aw, that's unbelievable. (beat) Yeah. Okay. Alright Lenny, thanks again. Take care. (hangs up the phone, and then, to Elaine) That was Lenny West, my accountant, who is a hell of a guy. And he handles the Yankees too; it's his biggest account. So every once in a while they throw him a couple of seats and last weekend he gave them to his daughter. She's an artist, by the way. Anyway, her daughter gives 'em to some friends, you know. One of her friends shows up wearing a Baltimore cap! (beat) You're from Baltimore, right?
Um, oh, it's Townscend, which is NEAR Baltimore.
Yeah, but you're an Oriole fan, right?
Well, uh, fan. My father--
Anyway, she refused to take the cap off; caused a whole big scene!
Really?
Yeah.
So... impudent.
Yeah, so Lenny gave me the tickets for tomorrow night. I'm inviting Frank and Marsha. 'Wantcha to come.
(pause) Ah. I've-I've got plans, though, Mr. Li--
Well, break 'em. You missed the bris, I want you at the game.
(very reluctant) Okay.
Good. (Elaine stars to leave) Oh--and Elaine. You know the Baltimore cap you got in your office? Wear it. I'm gonna have a little fun with him.
That will be fun.
Nina's studio. Nina is working on a painting. Jerry is watching her, sitting on the sofa.]
How's it coming?
Good, good.
Seen any good movies lately?
No... not really. You?
No. I like a good comedy. You know, like a Neil Simon? You like Neil Simon?
Neil Simon? Uh, some of his stuff.
I've seen MOST of it. I guess my favorite would have to be, uh... Chapter 2. Have you ever seen that?
I don't know... maybe.
I have. Funny, funny. In fact it was on TV just the other night. Happened to catch it. (a knock is heard at the door) I couldn't help notice a STUNNING similiarity-- (Jerry is interrupted as Nina opens answer the door...)
Well, we've made our decision. We want "The Kramer."
Jerry's apartment, night. Jerry and George are watching a baseball game and talking.]
Five-thousand? Why would anybody buy Kramer for $5000? (laughs)
Boy, the Yankees cannot buy a hit tonight!
So is it all over between you and... Marsha Mason?
Yeah. (picks up Nina's painting George bought) And by the way, can you get this thing outta my house?
Tell you what, I'll make a deal with you. I'll sell it to you right now for ten bucks.
Uh, there's seems to be a lot of trouble in the area just behind the Yankee dugout.
Behind the dugout, that's where we were sitting the other day.
Well, we're not going to show it, we don't want to encourage that kind of behavior. Say, it's a young lady, and boy she's really going at it with the security guard. She's a fiesty one. And now they're getting the other security guard to come down. How do you like that Seegers? Boy, she's someting. (beat) And a ball to left field..."
the Armstrong's dining room. Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong are having Kramer over for dinner.]
...then, when I was seventeen, I ran away from home and hopped a steamship to Sweden. (beat) This steak is excellent, by the way.
More potatoes?
Yeah, sure. Please.
Yes, yes. Go on. You hopped a steamship to Sweden?
Yeah. (beat) And, it was a big one.
Hey. I got some bad news for you, buddy. I think your car got stolen again.
What are you talking about?
Well you parked it on eighty-fourth and Columbus, right?
Yeah.
Yep, well I just walked by there and that car is gone.
Oh yeah, I know.
Well, where is it?
What's the difference?
Well, there's no difference, you know, I'm just curious.
You always have to know everything that's going on, don't you?
What happened to the car?
If I don't tell you it will kill you, won't it?
Yeah, yeah, it'll kill me.
You have to know, you must know.
I must know.
Well, I'm not telling you.
Oh, come on.
Nope. I don't think so.
Well, please?
Not today, pal.
Okay, I beg you.
Now see? Just saying beg doesn't make it a real beg. You gotta put some beg into it.
Okay, please! Please tell me!
Alright, I'll tell you, but your begging needs a lot of work.
Okay, okay, what is it? Come on.
I loaned the car to George.
Ah, George, alright. Well, what for?
George and Elaine went to a flea market in Westchester, okay?!
Alright.
Huh?
Huh. I mean, what do they want to go there for?
Will you stop it already?!
You know, why didn't they ask me to go?
I don't know! How am I supposed to know?!
What, they don't like me?
*I* don't like you!
If they like me, why don't they ask me to go? Oh yeah.
I really think it looks good.
Ten bucks, how can you go wrong?
All bald people look good in hats.
You should have lived in the twenties and thirties, you know men wore hats all the time then.
What a bald paradise that must have been. Nobody knew.
Well, you can wear a hat all the time now. Who's stopping you?
No, I can't. What if I meet a woman? I'd always be worried about that first moment where I'd take it off and see that look of disappointment on her face.
Are you sure you like these sunglasses?
Well I'm very disappointed in George and Elaine. And you know I'm somebody you don't want to have on your bad side.
Why not?
Because I'm like ice, buddy. When I don't like you, you've got problems. (notices some snacks on the table) Oh, is this for the fight?
Yep. (checks watch) Starts in thirty-five minutes.
Oh hey, you know I invited Mike Moffit. You don't mind, do you?
No, I like Mike.
Yeah, I just got off the phone with him, you know we had a great conversation.
Oh yeah? What did you talk about?
Well actually we talked about you. Yeah. He had some pretty interesting things to say.
Oh yeah? What did he say?
You have to know everything, don't you?
No, come on, Kramer. What did he say?
Why is that? Why do you have to know everything?
Kramer, just tell me what the guy said.
Beg me.
Please, don't make me beg.
No no no, I want you to beg me. And I don't want you to say it, I just want you to put some beg into it. Go on.
Kramer, please tell me what the guy said.
No no no, that's no good. No, I really don't think that's a beg. No, it's close, but uh...
Kramer!
Look, I can't say anything. You know, the guy told me the stuff in confidence, I'd be betraying a friend.
Well you can't just mention it and then not tell me.
Alright. I'll tell you but you can't say anything to him.
I'm not saying anything, I'm putting it in the vault, I'm locking the vault, it's a vault!
He thinks you're a phony.
He what?
I told you, he thinks you're a phony.
A phony? He called me a phony?
A big phone. A big one.
Why did you tell me that if I can't say anything?!
You begged me.
Do you hear that?
Of course I hear that.
You had to move the mirror?
I wanted to check out my sunglasses.
I went to look in the mirror, it wasn't there. You threw off my equilibrium.
Oh yeah, blame it on me because you can't drive, George.
I can't drive?
Yeah.
Nobody drives like me. Nobody. I'm doing things in this car, you have no idea they're going on. Wanna see me make a right turn from the left lane? Watch this.
No, I really don't.
And I can make a left turn from the right lane too.
I'm sure you could.
What are we gonna tell Jerry about the car?
I don't know.
Alright, start looking for spaces.
Oh, you're never gonna find a space on Jerry's block, just put it in a garage.
Look, I have my system. First I look for the dream spot right in front of the door, then I slowly expand out in concentric circles.
Oh come on, George, please put it in a garage. I don't want to spend an hour looking for a space.
I can't park in a garage.
Why?
I don't know, I just can't. Nobody in my family can pay for parking, it's a sickness. My father never paid for parking; my mother, my brother, nobody. We can't do it.
I'll pay for it.
You don't understand. A garage. I can't even pull in there. It's like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay, when if I apply myself, maybe I could get it for free? (he hears a horn honking) What? What do you want? Go around me, I'm looking for spaces.
(pointing backwards) Oh George, there's a space right there!
(putting the car in reverse) Oh beautiful! Look at that, the dream space right in front of Jerry's building. Huh? Dreams can come true, what did I tell you?
You didn't even have to take it out to dinner.
Alright, now you're gonna see some parallel parking. (spitting into his hands and rubbing them together) How I wish you could make a living parallel parking. (turning around in his seat) It's all geometry, knowing all the angles, when to make that first turn and then when to swing it back in, that's the key.
Will you just park it already?
There's nothing I can even impart to you, that's the sad thing. It's so inborn, I can't pass it on. (begins backing into the space) Look at this guy. Are you crazy, what are you doing?! Hey! Hey, you're stealing my space!
George, wait, you don't know who this guy is, people kill for a parking space in this city.
No no no, he's not getting away with this.
George?
Hey, what are you doing?
I think I'm parking my car.
You can't do that, you can't just sneak in from the back like that.
I'm not sneaking. I didn't even know you were parking, you were just sitting there three spaces up.
Well if you didn't think I was parking, why did you put it in head first?
Well that's the way I park. Anyway, you didn't start backing in until I pulled in.
I was in the middle of a conversation.
Hey, buddy, what can I tell you?
The point is I was here first.
I was closer to this space than you were.
But I'm backing in! You can't put it in head first!
I can if I have room!
Are you gonna move the car?
No, I'm not gonna move the car.
Jerk!
Oh, you're not?
Do you believe this guy?
Come on, we'll put it in a garage.
I am not putting it in a garage, it's my space.
What are you gonna do, you just gonna leave it here like this? Uh. I'm going upstairs.
Are you coming back down?
Yeah, I gotta tell Jerry we're here. I gotta go to the bathroom.
Alright, just make sure he reserves the good chair for me. Wait, what are you gonna tell him about the clanking noise in the car?
Me? No no no, you. You're gonna tell him. I'm not gonna tell- Noo.
Oh, come on, you're good at this.
What am I gonna say?
I don't know, I don't know, you'll think of something.
Oh god, I need a drink, do you got any Hennigan's here?
Yeah, under the counter. What happened?
Oh god. Oh, Jerry it was so terrible what we just went through on the way home. (pouring a big shot of scotch) You wouldn't believe it. (pushing a bag of chips off the counter)
(bending down to pick up the chips) Tell me what happened.
(after pouring the shot in the sink while Jerry was distracted and pretending to have downed it) Okay. Now listen. We were at the toll booth at the Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?! And there were these, like, this pack of extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us, okay?! And for some reason, I don't know, they just started to taunt us! And so then we payed the toll, and then we went through, and then they started to follow us, alright?! So George tries to lose them, and, and, but they were in this really like a souped up car, you know?! And so he turned off the road really suddenly and the car was on two wheels and I was just screaming! And then, George is such a great driver.
He is?
Oh, he is fantastic! And then they fired a gun right up in the air.
A gun?!
I think it was a gun. And then they followed us all the way into the city, and then they just stopped and they turned around and they went home.
My god, are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm alright. Oh, by the way, the car hit a pothole and now it's making a clanking noise.
Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that, that's the important thing.
Exactly.
Where's George now?
Oh, he's out in front of the building. He's arguing with some guy about a parking space.
What are you talking about?
Look out the window, you'll see.
(leaning out the window) Hey Georgie!
Hey!
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Crazy kids, huh?
What?
(desperate to distract Jerry) Ow!! (Jerry looks over) It's my cuticle.
Is that Jerry? Jerry?!
Oh, hey Mike.
What, you know Jerry?
Yeah, I know Jerry.
How do you know him?
What's the difference?
Because I know him too, and probably a lot better than you.
Well, bully for you. Hey, Jerry! You know your friend here's a real piece of work!
I'm coming down.
Hey, will you tell Kramer I'm outside?
What, you know Kramer?!
Hi.
(acting standoffish) Hello.
Hey, your friend Mike's outside, he wants to talk to you.
(out the window) Hey, Mike! Come on up, the fight's almost starting!
And you're watching the fight at Jerry's?
Yeah.
Oh great.
You know that guy downstairs?
Yeah, he's a real phony.
What's going on?!
Hey, will you come on down? This guy's in my space!
It's my space!
I'll be down in a minute.
Are you going down?
Yeah.
Is anything wrong?
(leaving) Why should anything be wrong?
(heading for the bathroom) Be down in a minute.
Hey pal, you're not getting that space. I mean, I'll sleep in my car if I have to.
I'll die out here.
He was down there. Once he passed his front bumper, it's no longer his space.
No, it doesn't matter. He was-
Hey! Jerry! Long time no see!
Hi Mike. (Noticing George's fedora) Indiana.
Hey Krame! You know this guy?
Yeah, yeah, I know him.
(to Jerry) You're looking tremendous. What are you on some kind of regimen?
Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too much so I found a store to mix it up special for me, they take it down another fifteen percent.
(laughing way too loud and hard) Ha ha ha ha!!! That's killer! Killer! I love that! Ha ha ha!!! You gotta use that, that's a definite!! Ha ha ha!!!
Oh, come on.
Hey! Your friend here has some real problems.
Me? You see what he did here, you see how he tried to sneak into my space?
Hey, just 'cause I went in front first doesn't mean I'm sneaking in.
You only went in front first 'cause you saw me backing up and you didn't have room to parallel park!
I only went in front first 'cause I could make it in front first and if you pull out I'll show you!
You've got a prayer.
I go in front first all the time.
Front first, that's how you park when you're pulling a bank job.
Did you talk to him?
Yeah, it's all taken care of.
You told him? What did you tell him?
I did a number on him, it was a thing of beauty, you really had to have been there to appreciate it.
I don't believe it, what did you say?
I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing us and they followed us into the city.
A pack of teenagers?
Yeah, by the time I got to the end of the story, he was to relieved that we were alive he couldn't care less about the car.
You are a genius, it's as simple as that.
What can I say, you know? It's a gift. I only wish I could teach it but, you know it's inborn.
By the way, thanks a lot for inviting me to the flea market.
What?
Yeah, Jerry, he told me all about it.
Oh great.
I didn't know.
Oh, so that's why you were acting so funny.
Well I didn't know you wanted to go to the flea market.
A flea market? You went to a flea market??
Hey, who's talking to you?
We just didn't think of you.
You said it, sister.
What? Every time I leave my house now I have to call everybody I know and ask them if they want to do what I'm doing?
Great move, telling him, by the way, real smart move.
I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say anything!
Judgement, Jerry, judgement! You exercised no judgement.
You're right. My fault.
Kramer? I'm so sorry, really.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I don't care for that sorry.
What was wrong with that sorry? It was a good sorry. Jerry, was that a good sorry?
It was a so-so sorry.
Hey! Move this car, I gotta get through!
You heard the man. I guess you gotta be moving your car.
And like you're not gonna just back it in if I do that?
Well somebody better move something soon! I got a truck full of ice cream here!
You see, they had to move the cars so the truck could get through, right? But these guys don't trust each other so they got these two nonpartisan drivers to move them.
Wild pack of teenagers, huh?
Yeah.
Amazing how they picked you, out of everyone, to terrorize.
Yeah. I know, I said to myself, 'Why us?' You remember?
Uh huh.
Sounds like you did some pretty nifty maneuvering,
Well, you know, It's interesting, you know, under that pressure, what you're capable of.
Right.
I learned a lot about myself.
What did you do to my car?!
I couldn't help it! Elaine moved the mirror, I got discombobulated.
Oh, like you've ever been bobulated.
I thought you said you were a good driver!
No no, I never said I was a good driver, I said I was a good parker.
I think you said driver.
Parker, I never said driver, I said parker, a great parker.
Will you move it up a little bit?
No no no, that's in the right position.
No no, I was further in.
No you weren't. Stop there, that's fine.
Do you mind?
Do you?
Hey, somebody better move these cars, you're making a commotion.
Hey Sid.
Who are you?
Never mind who I am. I know who I am. Do you know who you are? (to George) Why is it every time you park a car in this block, everything gets disrupted and disjointed?
Sid, it's completely his fault.
Oh, right.
Why don't you start taking the bus?
Okay, George. Come on, let's go. I'm putting it in a garage. The fight's starting in two minutes.
Don't do it!
What are we gonna do, stay out here all night?
Yes! I'm not giving him the satisfaction, it's my space.
Why don't you just flip a coin already?
No no, this is a matter of principle. That would just be saying that anybody could just pull into any parking space any way they want. Well I'm making a stand here. I'm saying *no* to head first parking. I'm not putting up with that. We put up with too much crap in this city, we're not putting up with head first parking.
You know, maybe if you hadn't been sitting there pontificating about what a great parker you were, you might have got the space.
So you're against me now?
He could have pulled up to the car and backed in, but he chose to go in head first.
No he couldn't, because the other car was already backing in.
No he wasn't.
All that matters is who was there first.
Ahh, you're not even old enough to drive, you little puke.
You just spit on me!
Don't you raise your voice to me!
You're not my father.
Hey Matthew.
Hi Jerry. This guy's really a jerk.
How ya doing?
Okay.
Hey, how's your father? I hear he's closing his store.
What?!
Oh no, nothing.
What's happened to daddy? He's going out of business?
No, no, no, no.
We're not going to have any money? We're out of money?
No, of course not, of course not!
Mommy!? Jerry says daddy's closing the store. He's going out of business. We don't have any money?
Jerry?! What's the matter with you?
I didn't--
(to Kramer) Boy, I don't know about your friend, Jerry. He says some pretty stupid things sometimes.
Oh, congratulations.
What for?
Well, you're pregnant.
What?
You're not pregnant?
No, I'm not pregnant.
Are you sure you're not pregnant?
Yes, I'm sure!
That's weird.
Come on, Matthew.
No.
Come on, Matthew!
I thought she was pregnant.
(to Elaine) Hey, do you think I'm phony?
What?
Mike thinks I'm a phony.
He thinks you're a phony?
Yeah, but I can't say anything because Kramer wasn't supposed to tell me.
Oh, you have to say something.
I can't, I told Kramer I was vaulting it.
You gotta open the vault.
Open my vault?
Open your vault.
Once I open the vault, it ceases to be a vault.
You have no choice.
Oy ga-vault.
(to Kramer) You wanna know why you can't go in front first? I'll tell you why. because it signals a breakdown in the social order. Chaos. It reduces us to jungle law.
When can you park head first?
Never.
What are you asking this guy for?
Who's talking to you?
He's right. never.
Oh yeah? What if you got ten car lengths? You have to pull all the way up to the front car?
Well, I suppose if you got ten car lengths.
When do you ever have ten car lengths?
What about Sundays and holidays?
Oh please.
What's going on here?
Oh, this guy tried to sneak into my space.
I really hate people who do that. I hope you don't let him get away with it.
Well, thank you for your support.
Hey, that's a great hat.
Really? You like it? I got it at a flea market today.
Hey George, nice hat.
Yeah, thanks.
Can I try it on?
No! It, uh, it wouldn't fit you.
Well sure it would.
No! Get out of here, Newman.
Come on, let me try it on.
No, Newman, stop it.
Let him try it on.
I don't want him to!
What is wrong with you?
You wanna see?! (pulling off the hat to reveal the bald pate) There! There it is! (turning to Newman) Alright, here! You wanna try on the hat?! Here! Try on the hat!
Stop it, George, stop it. I was defending your parking.
Alright, just keep the hat!
Alright, that's it. The fight's already started. I'm going upstairs, who's coming? Elaine?
It depends on who's going. (to George) Are you going?
I'm not going if he's going.
Me either.
I'm not going if he's going.
Well I'm going.
Well if he's going then I'm not going.
But it's your house.
I still don't have to go.
Well I don't want to go if Jerry's not going.
Why won't you go if I go?
Why? I'll tell you why.
No. Don't, Jerry.
Like you didn't call me a phony?
What? (to Kramer) Thanks! Real good! Jerry! First of all, I think you completely misunderstood what I said. I meant it in a complementary way. I mean, you know when people say, 'He's bad', it really means he's good, sort of thing? You know, slang.
Use it in a sentence.
Man, that Michael Jordan is so phony. (to Kramer) Why'd you tell him?!?
He begged me.
He begged you?!
Alright, come on. Who wants to watch the fight?
Okay, who's cars are these? Let's move 'em. Let's go.
Officer, could I just explain something to you?
Hey. Let's go or I'm gonna write both of you a ticket in about two minutes.
Officer, he can't pull in head first.
Officer, he backed up from down the street. He was double-parked, he was
Alright, you move your car. It's his space, you can't go in head
Wait a second. Why can't he go in head first? He said the guy was just sitting over there.
What are you talking about? This guy was here first.
But he didn't take it.
Hey, it's his space.
No, it's his space.
Well, you're gonna have to go to the bathroom!
Well, you're gonna have to go to work!
I don't have a job!
Neither do I!
Seven... Eight... Nine... Ten. *ding*
So, I fly a lot. I like planes. I was on a plane the other day and I was wondering - are there keys to the plane? Do they need keys to start the plane? Maybe that's what those delays on the ground are sometimes. When you're just sitting there at the gate, maybe the pilot's just up there in the cockpit going (mimics looking for keys) "Oh, I don't believe this. Oh my god...I did it again." They tell you it's something mechanical, because they don't want to come on the PA system..."Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be delayed here on the ground for a little while, I uh...Oh God, this is so embarrassing...I - I left the keys to the plane in my apartment." You see the technicians all running underneath the plane; you think they're servicing it, but they're actually looking for the magnet "hide-a-key" under the wing..."maybe he left it up there somewhere..."
Jerry's apartment in the middle of the night. Jerry comes out of his room. We hear his thoughts.
What is it about sleep that makes you so thirsty? Do dreams require liquid? It's not like I'm running a marathon, I'm just lying there.
What the hell...? Why is the door open?
Kramer, what are you doing here!?
Jerry, now calm down, it's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't want to wake you up! Y'know, I was watching "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo," and I - y'know, I wanted to get some popcorn, and I, uh...I used the spare keys that you gave me to come into your apartment to get your popper.
You scared me!
It's just me.
That's enough!
Forgot the popper... (goes to the kitchen, grabs the popper, drops the lid, juggles it around, then exits.)
C'mon...c'mon...
Kramer! What are you doing?!
What does it look like I'm doing? What?
Get out! Get out of the bathroom, I gotta go!
Alright, alright...
C'mon!
Sorry.
Move it! Move it! Get going!
My drain's all clogged up! (Comes out of the bathroom in a towel, covered in soap suds.)
Is that my towel?
I'm really happy the movie was sold out.
Hey, did you ever pretend there's like, murderers chasing you, and you try and see how fast you can get your keys out and get into your apartment?
I'm from Witchita, so...
Oh. I see. There he is! (Pretends the murderers are coming.)
Hurry, Jerry! He's coming! Hurry!
The murderers! (Jerry unlocks his door and they both run inside.)
That was close!
Did you see the look on that guy's face?
You were so fast with those keys. (They prepare to kiss, but are interrupted by Kramer and his girlfriend coming out of Jerry's bedroom, laughing and horsing around.)
Kramer! What the hell are you doing here?!
Hey, Jerry! How are ya? I thought you were going to the movies.
All right, that's it. Hand 'em over.
What?
What, you know what, the keys. I want the keys. You've lost your key privileges.
Oh, come on!
No, come on!
What, what, I thought you went to the movies!
It was sold out!
Now how was I supposed to know it was going to be sold out?
That's the point.
What point?
Just, look, just give the keys.
Just give me another chance!
Don't ask me!
I'm asking you!
I'm telling you.
You're joking.
I'm serious!
It's not going to happen again!
Yes it will, now give me those keys!
O.K., fine, go ahead, you take the keys! But you're going to regret this. (He angrily storms out. Kramer then re-enters seconds later when he realizes he's left his girlfriend in Jerry's apartment.)
So put 'em in a safe place.
I will.
Where?
I don't know. I'll hide 'em. So, is Kramer upset?
I think so. I mean, he's acting really weird lately...he's different.
Well, maybe you should just give him the keys back.
I can't.
Is that Kramer? (Jerry nods.)
Who's there?
Uh, Kramer. (Jerry opens the door, Kramer enters. Elaine waves at Kramer with the keys in her hand.) Oh, hi...uh...you got the...
Oh, I'm not, uh...
No, no, no, it's o.k. I don't care about the keys. It's my fault. I gave the keys away with my stupidity. I broke "the covenant of the keys."
Jerry, give him the keys back.
Elaine...
I don't want the keys back! No, I'm glad the way things turned out. I was clingin' to those keys, man! Like a branch on the banks of a raging river. And now I have let go. And I'm free...to go with the current. To float. (To Jerry) And I thank you.
Take the keys.
I don't want the keys! (Jerry tries to force the keys on Kramer, but Kramer refuses.)
O.K.!
Now, one more thing - I would like my keys back.
Your spare set?
That's right.
You want 'em back?
Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be for the best.
Gee, Kramer, I uh...I don't know what to say.
Say yes! Yes, George. Yes!
Should I give you my keys, is that the transaction, trading keys...? Because Elaine has my keys.
Well, you can get 'em back.
I suppose I could.
Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment? That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house, it was like I was on vacation. Better food, better view, better TV. And cleaner? Oh - much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes. I was living in twilight, George. Living in the shadows. Living in the darkness...like you.
Me?
Oh, yeah. I can barely see you, George.
Alright, stop it Kramer, you're freakin' me out. (The waitress comes over.)
Hi, are you ready to order? (George tries to order, but Kramer interrupts.)
Do you ever yearn?
Yearn? Do I yearn?
I yearn.
You yearn.
Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn. Often, I...I sit...and yearn. Have you yearned?
Well, not recently. I craved. I crave all the time, constant craving...but I haven't yearned.
Look at you.
Aw, Kramer, don't start...
You're wasting your life.
I am not! What you call wasting, I call living! I'm living my life!
O.K., like what? No, tell me! Do you have a job?
No.
You got money?
No.
Do you have a woman?
No.
Do you have any prospects?
No.
You got anything on the horizon?
Uh...no.
Do you have any action at all?
No.
Do you have any conceivable reason for even getting up in the morning?
I like to get the Daily News!
George, it's time for us to grow up - and be men. Not little boys.
Why?
I'm goin' to California. You know, I got the bug.
Yeah, I think I got a touch of something, too.
No, the acting bug. Ever since I was in that Woody Allen movie.
"These pretzels are making me thirsty"? That was one line! You got fired!
I know, I know, but man! I never felt so alive! Now, are you coming with me?
Uh, no, I'm not.
Alright, suit yourself. But let's keep this between us - we're key brothers now. (Gets up to leave.)
You're not really gonna go to California, are you?
Up here, I'm already gone. (Kramer exits.)
Anyway, so he gave me his spare keys, now he wants to have my keys, so I need mine back from you.
Just 'cause you have his keys? Why does he need yours?
I don't know. He said he wants to be my "key brother."
That's ridiculous.
That's Kramer.
I'll give you back your spare keys - but now I want mine back.
What for?
'Cause. I'll give 'em to Jerry.
Jerry? Why?
'Cause he gave me his.
So what?
So, if he has my keys, I should have his.
Well, I don't see why if you have his, he should have yours.
I just said the same thing to you.
What?
What?
Alright, listen, I'll give you your spare keys, but I don't have them with me. Can I please have mine to give to back to Kramer?
Yeah, O.K. I'll go get 'em. (George begins to leaf through papers on Elaine's counter.) What are you doing? Would you just put that down? (Takes the papers away from George.) I gotta get some new friends.
Did you bring the keys?
Yes, but I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's apartment without his permission.
This could be an emergency!
You never should have taken away his keys!
I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em. (Jerry and George go out into the hallway to Kramer's apartment.)
How'd the Mets do?
They lost.
Kramer?
Hello, boys.
Hello, Newman.
You lookin' for someone?
Don't play coy with me, Newman, I'm not in the mood!
Coy? I'm not being coy.
Is he being coy?
Yeah, coy.
You're being coy. Now where's Kramer, Newman?
Who?
Listen, Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer is and wanna know now!
Alright, go ahead and hit me, Seinfeld. I got witnesses.
Turn around, George.
Sure. (Turns around.)
George?
Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have to do this the hard way? (Hits wall with his fist.)
Help! Help!
Where's Kramer?
HELP! (Elaine enters.)
What's going on?
They're gonna beat me up!
No we're not.
We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer.
You wanna know what happened to Kramer? I'll tell you what happened to Kramer. He was ticked off. About the keys. Yeah, that's right - about the keys. Thought he got a bad rap.
Bad rap?
Yeah. From you.
Me?
You heard me. So he packed it up and split for the coast. La-La Land. L.A.
L.A.?
I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it! I had no choice! He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you saw it, remember? I said, 'Take the keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. You saw it, didn't you see it?
Yeah, yeah, I saw it. (mutters under her breath) I mean, it's complete bullshit.
Huh?
What...?
No, what'd you say?
Nothing. I didn't say anything.
Oh, you didn't see it.
Yeah, I saw it. I saw it! I did, I saw it. Yep.
I heard you say something, there.
I didn't say anything.
I'm calling Kramer's mother. (Picks up the phone, dials.) (To Elaine) I don't know what you said. But it was something. I heard something. Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer? Mrs. Kramer? Could you turn the music down? Could you turn the music down!
Ask her about Kramer.
She's drunk out of her mind.
Elaine? Are you there? It's me, I'm locked out of my apartment, I need my spare keys. Where are you? I'm at the coffee shop.
Hey! You ever been in an accident?
About five years ago. I was going down this very road. Same time of day, going about the same speed I'm going now...there was a rock in the road. Couldn't have been more than a pebble. Never really saw it! Lost control of the bike, went flyin' about a hundred feet - came down right on my head. Cracked it wide open! Blood and stuff was just splattered all over the road, there...I broke every bone in my face. Hey, you know, when they found me, my eyes were hanging out of their sockets? Yeah, they pronounced me dead at the scene. I was in a coma for...well, they told me about a year...said I'd be a vegetable for life. Yeah, but I showed 'em. Ever since then I always wear a helmet! (The biker goes into a turn.) Lean! (Kramer yells.)
Georgie Boy! Way to come through with the keys! Sit down, I'm buying you dinner.
Look, I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin' about it, I just don't feel right about letting you into Elaine's apartment.
Don't feel right? What are you talking about?
Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you want to go into Elaine's...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can I just let you in?
What is the big deal?
Just because you have someone's spare keys, it doesn't entitle you to break into their apartment. That's the reason you took away Kramer's keys.
First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys. You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me, because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys.
Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer, he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her.
Well, I want those keys. (Tries to grab the keys from George.)
Nope, no can do.
George, give them to me, I want these keys. (They struggle over the keys.) I don't want to get physical!
Do you wanna fight?
Do you wanna fight?
I'll fight ya! Not the face! Not the face! (The struggle continues.)
And then, the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome young prince.
Oh no. He didn't take back the keys, no way.
Yes! And then the handsome young prince was cast out into the cruel, cruel world.
Oh man, what a bummer. That ogre dude's pretty cold, huh?
Oh, he's cold.
Lemme tell you something, Kramer. If that ogre dude pulled that crap on me (pulls out a knife) - I'D STAB HIM! I'D CUT HIM IN HALF! I'D GUT HIM LIKE A FISH, MAN! That's what I'd do!
Yeah, yeah...that'd be funny. (To driver) Hey, you can drop me here!
Hey, what's the rush, man?
Well, you know, I gotta be goin' now.
Hey, Kramer - have you ever killed a man?
What do you think, junior? You think these hands have been soakin' in Ivory liquid? (mimics choking somebody)
Don't leave, Kramer, stay with us. You know so much about the world, we need you, please Kramer! (they all start chanting) Please, Kramer! Please, Kramer! (Scene ends with Kramer trying to escape their clutches.)
Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could get mine.
You're right, how did I miss that? (Begins unlocking the door, mutters under his breath) Maybe because it's a crock of shit.
What's that?
Nothing.
I heard something.
Didn't say anything. (They go into Elaine's apartment.)
So, how long you been drivin' this thing?
Goin' on four years.
Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi.
Nothin'? (They exchange a glance, then laugh.) Listen to you, you're quite the sweet-talker.
You know, I always wanted to drive the big rigs. I used to watch those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle.
You want to give it a try?
Really?
Do you know how to double-clutch?
Yeah.
Well, come on! (They trade places and Kramer gets behind the wheel. Kramer turns out to be really rusty on the ol' double-clutch.)
They were in here, I saw her put 'em in here!
Well, this is great.
Well, what do they look like?
They look like keys, George. They look exactly like keys. (In disgust) "What do they look like."
Well, they're obviously not here.
Well, they've gotta be here somewhere.
Jerry, unless I pull down on this statuette and a hidden wall opens up, we have checked every square inch of this apartment!
What is this? "Murphy Brown"?
What?
By Elaine Benes?
What?
Elaine's writing a "Murphy Brown"?
Lemme see this. (Tries to grab the papers.)
Wait a second! (They fight over the paper.)
Gimme half!
All right, here!
Why didn't she tell us?
Elaine is writing a sitcom...! (Elaine enters the room behind Jerry and George. Jerry spots her and tosses his half of the script at George. George throws it back and paper goes flying everywhere.)
You weasels!
What? What?
How dare you!
We hardly read anything!
It was funny!
Who gave you permission to come into my house and just go through all my things? You thought it was funny?
Well... (picks up some of the pages) From what I saw...
Well, it's just a first draft!
I was locked out of my apartment, I'm just trying to get my keys.
Why did you let him in?! (Shoves George.)
He forced me to!
I did not!
Yes you did!
You! Get out! Get out! Get out!
Elaine, wait! I need my spare keys!
Here! Here's your damn keys, you keep 'em! I don't want 'em anymore!
Good!
And I want my keys back from you!
What, you don't want me to hold your keys?
No, you can't be trusted!
Alright, alright, fine. (Gives the keys to Elaine.)
And I don't want you to hold mine!
Good! I won't!
Good! Don't! Are these my keys?
These aren't my keys!
Whose are these?
I don't know!
I just thought I could write it.
Is that something you want to do?
I don't know. Those writers make a lot of money.
Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard work! You don't just write a "Murphy Brown." You gotta watch the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to each other.
O.K., can I just watch the show? (mutters under her breath) God, what an asshole.
What did you say?
I didn't say anything.
I heard something. (Looks at the TV) Elaine, Elaine! It's Kramer! Kramer's on "Murphy Brown"!
Kramer's on "Murphy Brown"!
Look, there he is, he's sittin' at the desk!
Hi, I'm Murphy Brown, you must be my new secretary.
Oh, good morning, Miss Brown.
And you are...?
Oh, I'm uh, Steven Snell.
Snell. Well, hello, Mr. Snell.
Steven.
Steven. Are you familiar with this computer system?
Oh - I'm familiar with it.
Steven Snell? I know people...and I have a very good feeling about you. (exits.)
Kramer was on Murphy Brown?
Yeah.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Murphy Brown, the TV show.
C'mon, will ya?
Kramer was on Murphy Brown? That son of a gun!
Something, isn't it?
With Candace Bergen!
I know!
I've always liked her. Remember her in 'Carnal Knowledge'?
Sure.
Did she show her breasts in that?
She's not really the naked type.
I can't believe I missed Kramer. You know he asked me to go with him to California.
He did?
Yeah, I turned him down.
How come you didn't tell me?
He asked me to keep it a secret.
But you can never keep a secret.
I know. This was like a record. My previous record was when Joni Hirsch asked me not to tell anybody that we slept together. Kept a lid on that for about 28 seconds.
Well, you've come a long way.
I've matured.
Hey listen, the Tonight Show called me, they want me to come out and do the show on the 28th and they're giving me two free tickets to LA. You wanna go?
A free ticket?
Yeah, in fact we could track down Kramer. I always felt bad about the way he left, you know? That was a mess. I never should have taken back those keys.
What about accommodations?
All taken care of.
Is there a meal allowance? What about seat assignments? Could I have the Kosher meal? I hear the Kosher meal is good. And I need clothes. Gotta get a haircut. Gonna have to, I have to refill my allergy medication. Oh, do I need a hat? I need a hat, don't I? Could we do the Universal tour? They have that Backdraft exhibit now, that looks very cool to me...
So my acting technique, my personal acting technique is working with color, imagining color, then finding the emotional vibrational mood connected to the color. See, if you look through my scripts, you'll see that all my lines have a special color, so I don't memorize language, I memorize color. This way I can go through red, yellow, green, blue. And I have a full palette of emotions.
Hey, didn't I tell you to get out of here?
Uh, did you?
C'mon, let's go.
Well, I was just--
Yeah yeah, you were just nothing. C'mon, let's go.
Alright, we'll talk about this a little later. Are you an actor?
Murphy Brown.
Uh, yeah, uh, Candace Bergen please.
Who's calling please?
Ah, well, just tell her that it's Kramer.
Alright I'll uh, I'll call her at home. (To man waiting behind him) Go ahead, it's all yours.
Hello Kramer.
Oh, uh, Helena, how are you?
I haven't worked since 1934, how do you think I am?
Well, that's only uh, 58 years.
It was a Three Stooges short, "Sappy Pappy." I played Mr. Sugarman's secretary, remember?
Yeah, right, right, yeah, yeah, that was a Shemp, right?
No, a Curly. The boys played three sailors who find a baby, the baby's been kidnapped and the police think that they did it.
Uh huh, right.
But, but of course they didn't do it, the police had made an awful mistake.
Right.
Moe hits Curly with an axe,
Uh huh.
The Stooges catch the kidnappers,
Right.
But it's too late.
Really.
The baby's dead.
Really?
The boys are sent to Death Row and are executed.
Well I don't remember that part.
I play Mr. Sugarman's secretary.
Oh, yeah, yeah, you were, you were very good.
Yeah, it was sad for a Three Stooges, what with the dead baby and the Stooges being executed and all.
Well, that was an unusual choice for the stooges.
Would you like to buy me a fat-free frozen yogurt at the store, Kramer?
Uh, well, uh, you know I can't right now, you know, uh, I got a very big meeting, I got these people interested in my movie treatment. So, uh, I guess we'll have to make it another time, alright?
Well No! No, don't go out there, Kramer, they'll hurt you, they'll destroy you. You'll never make it in this town, you're too sensitive like me,
Helena, you're wrong, you know I'm not that sensitive at all.
I was engaged to Mickey Rooney! He left me at the altar. Kramer! Kramer!
What is this?
What?
We're going on a two day trip, what are you, Diana Ross?
I happen to dress based on mood.
Oh. But you essentially wear the same thing all the time.
Seemingly. Seemingly. But within that basic framework there are many subtle variations, only discernable to an acute observer, that reflect the many moods, the many shades, the many sides of George Costanza.
(referring to George's outfit) And what mood is this.
This is Morning Mist.
What do you figure, 20? 21?
Close enough.
Forensics ought to be able to nail it down.
No ID?
No ID.
No witnesses?
Just the trees, Johnny. Pretty young thing.
She was. Not any more. Somebody saw to that.
Sure did, Johnny. Damn shame too. What do you make of it?
I don't know, but I don't like it.
Look at this guy, he's like a cat burglar. He thinks if he goes through real slow the machine won't detect him.
Personally I'm a little nervous about going through these things. I'm afraid I'm gonna step through into another dimension.
Just go.
Heh he, I made it.
Empty your pockets please.
Walk through again please.
Are you sure you don't have any metal on you? Bracelets? Rings? Anklets?
Anklets?
A lot of men wear anklets.
Really?
Yeah.
What do you have in your bag, sir?
My bag?
Step over here please.
Over here?
Do you have a knife in the bag?
A knife?
Open the bag, please.
What's this?
Moisturizer?
For your wife?
No, I uh... I use it.
Spread your arms and legs please.
(facing the lengthening line behind him) Ladies and gentlemen, I implore you.
Have a good trip.
Alright, go ahead.
That's it?
That's it.
Alright.
C'mon Jerry, let's go. What was that all about?
I must have iron rich blood.
Here we go, LA.
The Coast,
La-la Land. I got the window seat, right?
Who said that?
I called it.
Oh no.
What do you mean, oh no.
Oh ah, yeah, I'm here for the audition.
Which audition, the music video, the horror movie, the exercise tape or the infomercial?
Uh, let's see... well.
You scream good.
You too.
So, can I keep this treatment?
Oh yeah, yeah, I got 20 copies.
'Cause I can, uh, show it to my manager. He has connections with West German television money.
Really.
Yeah, they're trying to put together a miniseries for me on Eva Braun. I mean think about it, is that a great idea? We know nothing about Eva Braun, only that she was Hitler's girlfriend.
Um-hm.
What was it like having sex with Adolf Hitler? What do you wear in a bunker? What did her parents think of Hitler as a potential son-in-law? I mean it could just go on and on...
Wait wait, hold it, hold it. Look who's over there. Don't look, don't look! It's Fred Savage.
Big deal.
He'd be perfect for my movie. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. (takes a deep breath) I gotta go over there, I gotta give him a copy of my treatment.
Why are you breathing so hard?
Well, I'm just a little nervous. OK, I gotta relax. Phew. Wish me luck, huh?
Hey. Oh, did I frighten you? I'm not crazy. I mean, I may look weird, but I'm just like you, I'm just a regular guy just trying to make it in this business. You know I really like your work, the, uh...
Thank you.
Yeah, I can't remember the name of it.
Thanks.
Yeah, my mind's a blank, I'm sorta nervous, you know, uh...
That's ok. Relax, relax.
Ok, but I got this...
Stupid table. You know, I'm not normally like this, usually I'm very cool and charming, I don't mean to bother you or anything but I think it's fate that you happened to be here at the same time as me.
Yeah, its fate, you know, can't avoid your fate.
I got this treatment I think you'll be great in.
Yeah.
So I'd like to give it to you.
Yeah, thank you, thanks a lot. Bye!
(bumping into a lamp) Alright, excuse me. Uh wait, wait.
Yeah, Kramer. K-R-A-M-E-R. Uh, I don't know, wavy? George, how would you describe Kramer's hair?
Curly.
Wavy.
What'd you ask me for?
Yeah, I'll hold on. Hey George, did you see a piece of paper I had on the nightstand here, like crumpled up, like a napkin?
Nope.
'Cause I had like three jokes on it, they were all perfectly worded just the way I wanted to have it. Can't find it. Hello?
Hey, a shoe buffing machine!
I don't know, 6-3, George, how tall is Kramer?
You got your own shampoo, conditioner, body lotion! Jerry, body
About 6-3.
Ooh, a shower cap!
Coming.
Hello. I have more towels.
Oh good, good, come in. Come in, welcome. I'm George. And this is Jerry, over there, on the phone, that's Jerry. And you are, um?
Lupe.
Lupe. That's very nice, very nice. Listen, are you going to be making up the bed in the morning?
Oh Yes.
Fine. Excellent. Could you do me a favor? Could you not tuck the blankets in? 'Cause I can't sleep all tucked in.
Oh, yes, yes.
Yes, I like to just be able to take the blankets and swish them and swirl them, you know what I mean? You know, I don't like being all tucked in. I like to have a lot of room, you know I like to have my toes pointed up in the air. Just like to scrunch up the blankets.
Yes, yes. It's too tight to sleep.
Exactly, you know what I'm talking about, right?
Oh yees, It's too tight. (Gesturing towards Jerry) Him too?
Uh, Jerry, you want your blankets tucked in?
Excuse me, what?
You want your blankets tucked in?
What blankets?
When Lupe makes up the beds in the morning.
I don't know, whatever they do.
I tuck in? Yes?
Tuck in, tuck in.
Alright, so that's one tuck and one no-tuck.
Okay.
Yeah. One second sweetheart. Jerry, I really think it'd be easier if you didn't tuck.
Excuse me, fine, you don't want me to tuck, put me down for a no-tuck.
Two no-tucks.
Uh, hang on a second, You know what? Changed my mind, make it a tuck.
You just said you weren't tucking.
I'm tucking! Hello? Hello? They hung up on me. They don't know where Kramer is anyway.
Alrighty, so. That's one tuck and one no-tuck. Got that?
Excuse me, um, did you see a piece of paper on the nightstand here earlier today crumpled up like a napkin?
Oh, yes, yes. I throw away when we clean the room.
Oh, okay, thanks.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
Alright, Lupe, bye-bye now.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
I can't believe she threw that out. I had like the perfect wording of a whole joke I was gonna do about the X-ray counter at the airport, I was gonna do it on the Tonight Show, now I can't remember it.
Well what did you want her to do, you left it on the night table.
They're not supposed to just take everything and throw it out!
Hey, hey, hey! It's not Lupe's fault, you shouldn't have left it out.
Alright, just get your thing together and let's get out of here.
Alright, now. What mood am I in, what mood am I in?
You shouldn't have tucked.
I like it tucked.
Nobody tucks anymore.
Hey, Lieutenant.
Yeah.
This was found on her person.
On her person? What kind of expression is that?
I don't know, sir. Police lingo.
Oh yeah? What's your name, son.
Ross.
Ross. Do you see that person there, Ross?
Yes sir.
She's dead. Have you got that?
Yes sir.
Good. Now get out of here before you find yourself on transit patrol writing tickets to senior citizens with fake bus passes.
Yes sir.
I think we just caught a break.
This is very exciting! You're on the Tonight Show, NBC, who else is on the show?
I don't know.
Might meet a celebrity.
I can't believe she threw out my napkin.
What are you worried about, you know it.
You gonna be alright here?
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, go. Go about your business, I'll just wander around.
Alright, don't wander too far, I'll meet you back here in fifteen minutes.
Go, go, go, don't worry about it.
Hey. (pointing at him) Corbin Bernsen.
How ya doing?
Big fan! Big fan.
Yeah.
Hey, you grew a beard, huh?
Yeah, yeah. I'm doing a movie during my hiatus.
Hey. You know, do I have a case for you guys to do on L.A. Law.
Really.
...so mind you, at this point I'm only going out with her two or three weeks. So she goes out of town and she asks me to feed her cat. So at this time, there's a lot of stuff going on in my life and, uh, it slips my mind for a few days. Maybe a week. Not a week, five, six days.
Yeah yeah yeah. So what happened?
Well, it's the damnedest thing. The cat dies. So she comes back into town, she finds the cat lying on the carpet stiff as a board.
So you killed the cat.
That's what she says. I say, listen. It was an old cat. It died of natural causes. So get this, now she tells me that I gotta buy her a brand new cat. I say listen, honey. First of all, it was a pretty old cat. I'm not gonna buy you a brand new cat to replace an old dying cat. And second of all, I go out to the garbage, I find you a new cat in fifteen seconds. I say, you show me an autopsy report that says this cat died of starvation, I spring for a new cat. So she says something to me, like, uh, I dunno, get the hell out of here, and she breaks up with me. Now don't you think that would be a great case on L.A. Law?
I don't wanna tell you how to run your show.
Oh, of course not.
But really, it's enough with the bar already.
Yeah, well.
Seriously, have they though about changing the setting?
Doubt it, I doubt it. Yeah.
Really? Because people do meet in places besides a bar, huh?
Well yeah, they do, heh heh.
What about a rec room? Huh? Or a community center.
Yeah, you oughta write one of those.
Yeah?
Yeah, I'll bring it up with the producers, I gotta... uh...
Fabulous, I'll think about that George, thank you!
How's it going?
Great! Great! I actually just had two meaningful intelligent conversations with Corbin Bernsen and George Wendt.
Really?
Yeah, yeah, not fan talk, not gushing, you know? Actual conversation, I was incredibly articulate!
You got toilet paper on your heel there.
It's the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Tonight Jay welcomes Corbin Bernsen, George Wendt and comedian Jerry Seinfeld.
Oh yeah, yeah, people are always coming up to me trying to give me a great case for L.A. Law, just a few seconds ago, right here, right outside in the hallway this nut, some sick nut comes up to me and says he's supposed to watch this girl's cat while she's away out of town. Anyway he forgets to feed the cat, the cat dies, starves to death, he kills the cat, refuses to get her a new one, won't give her any money, won't pay her, and he wants Arnie Becker to represent him. Nice guy. Yeah, that'd make a *great* case for L.A. Law. Thanks a lot.
He's a very handsome man. Passionate, intense, but troubled, strange. I think he may be in love with me. Of course there's nothing abnormal about that, I have many suitors.
It's funny, 'cause even after all these years, we still get people giving us advice, how to improve the show. Actually, a few moments ago I ran into a nut back there, he said, you know, that maybe we should think about, you know, not doing the show in a bar.
So that's when I said, "Hey, Kramer, dude. You ever killed a man before?" And he said, "What do you think, Junior? These hands have been soaking in Ivory liquid?
The guy you talked to, what did he look like?
Short little bald guy with glasses.
Yeah, yeah, that's the same guy I talked to.
It never ends, does it?
So I'm going through the airport and I have to put my bag on that little uh, uh, the uh, that uh, the conveyor belt.
Issue an arrest warrant, put out an APB. Let's pick up this, uh, Kramer.
I was terrible.
What are you, crazy? You were fine.
Nah, did you hear the end? I couldn't remember what I was trying to say, that whole thing about the, uh...
Conveyor belt.
Yeah. Because she threw out my napkin.
I can't believe, you're blaming Lupe?
Yes, Lupe. I'm blaming Lupe.
Our top story tonight, there has been a break in the so called 'Smog Stranglings'. Police have just released a photo of the suspect being sought in connection with the slayings. He is known only as "Kramer".
He's on the lamb(?), he's on the loose!
Would you let go of my arm?! I'm trying to drive, you're getting us both killed!
What are we supposed to do? What do you do on a situation like this? Should we call a lawyer, should we call the police?
Obviously we're gonna call the police and tell that he's not the guy.
Hope he's not the guy.
Couldn't be the guy...nah.
God, I'm starved, I'm weak from hunger.
How can you think of food at the time like this?
Time like what? I'm hungry. My stomach doesn't know that Kramer's wanted.
I told you to have breakfast, you should've had breakfast!
I couldn't have breakfast, it was lunchtime! The three hour time difference threw me. I wanted a tuna fish sandwich, they wouldn't serve me tuna fish sandwich, because they were only serving breakfast.
You should've had some eggs.
For lunch? Who eats eggs for lunch?
Have you ever heard of egg salad?
Why didn't you say something then?
I've gotta to tell you about existence of egg salad?
I need food, Jerry. I feel faint, I'm getting light headed.
I've gotta call the police, there's a pay phone over there.
Pay phone in L.A., look it's a miracle.
I don't have any change. You've got any change?
No, I don't have any change. I never carry change.
Well, we need change and all I have is twenties.
I have a ten.
So, break it.
I hate asking for change. They always make a face. Like I'm asking them to donate a kidney.
So, buy something.
What?
I don't know, some mints or TicTacs.
Breath problem?
No, I just want some change.
Tell me.
Your breath is fine. It's delightful, it's delicious.
You know, I haven't eaten anything.
I just wanna call the police!
Why don't you just call 911?
But is this an emergency?
Of course it is.
How is this an emergency?
Your friend is been accused of being a serial killer. I think that qualifies.
All right, I'll call 911. Think he did it? Could've he done it? Couldn't done it? How could've he done it? Couldn't be? Could it? Hello 911? How are you? I'm sorry it was just a reflex...I know it's an emergency number...it is an emergency...my friend is being accused of being a smog strangler and I know he didn't do it...they're putting me trough to the detective in charge of the investigation...what is my name? Who am I? I'm eh...George Costanza...
What's the matter with you? Are you crazy? Why are you using my name?!
Oh, don't be a baby! What are you scared of?
What am I scared of? I'm scared of the same thing that you are, everything! Why don't you just use your own name?
Your name is a good name, Costanza. Sounds like it's stands for something, they'll believe us.
Really?
Sure.
You think so?
Oh yeah. Yes I have some very important information regarding the smog strangler. (George leans close) would you suck a mint or something. Can I come right now? I suppose, where are you located? Where is that? I don't know where we are. Where are we?
I don't know.
We don't know. He says ask somebody, ask that guy.
Excuse me, where are we?
Earth.
Hey, you know I'm on the phone with the police! Some guy just gave me a wise answer. Ask that woman.
Excuse me Ms. which street are we on?
I don't know.
You don't know?
I don't know.
How come you don't know what street are you on?
You don't know.
George, it says it here on the phone. It's 12145 Ventura Boulevard. Aha, ok...do we know where the 101 is? (George shakes his head) No...do we know where 170 is? (George shakes his head) No...do we know where 134 is? (George just looks at Jerry) No. Aha, ok. (Jerry hangs up) He's gonna send a black and white to pick us up.
Black and white?
A cop car.
Why didn't you just say that?
I thought it sounded kind of cool.
Oh yeah, real cool. You're a cool guy.
Oh, you are? I guaranty you, Lupe is going to tuck your covers in.
I'll bet you, how much?
Her tip.
You've got a bet.
Ok.
How much do you tip a chamber maid?
Which one of you is Costanza?
Get in.
Hi, how are you guys? Listen, does either one of you have like a mint or piece of gum or...
Jerry, would you do me a favor, close the window.
Hey, get out of here...hey officer, he's fooling around back here.
Cut it up back there.
He started it.
I did not. You guys gonna go through some red lights?
I don't think so.
But you could?
Oh yeah, of course we could. We can do anything we want.
We could drive on the wrong side of the road.
Yeah, we do that all the time. You should see the looks on people's faces.
Shoot people...
You guys ever shot anybody?
No...
Hey, can I flip on the siren?
Why are you bothering them for?
I'm just asking, all they have to do is say no.
Yeah, go ahead.
Wohoo, check it out.
Can I try it?
Yeah, go ahead, hurry up.
Scared the hell out of that guy.
You know what I never understood? Why did they change the siren noise? When I was a kid it was always "waaaa, waaaa", you know now it "woo-woo-woo-woo-woo". Why did they do that, did they do some research? Did they find that woo-woo was more effective than waa?
Yeah, what about those English sirens, you know...eee-aaa-eee-aaa-eee-aaa...
Eee-aaa-eee-aaa-eee-aaa...
Hey!
I'm dizzy.
Nice shotgun.
Thanks.
Clean as a whistle.
You could eat of that shotgun.
What is that, a 12 gauge?
Yeah.
12 gauge. Seems to be the most popular gauge.
My favorite.
Mine too, love the 12 gauge.
Makes the 11 gauge look like a cap pistol.
What do got over there?
I don't know.
Looks like a possible 5-19.
5-19? What's a 5-19?
Where?
Think so?
Looks like it.
I can't believe this. A 5-19?
Where, where? I can't see.
This is car 23, we have a possible 5-19 in progress, over.
All right, let's pull over and check it out.
Pull over? You can't pull over.
What are you doing? Where do you think you're going?
Pull over? The lieutenant is waiting to see us.
Hey hey hey, we're in a rush here.
We have an appointment!
What are you doing?!
Great.
There's a bag of Pepperidge Farm cookies up there.
Which flavor?
Milano.
Cops eating Milanos. What crazy town is this?
Should I take some?
I think that's a 5-19.
I'm starving...
They're busting this guy.
They're cuffing him.
I can't believe this.
Hi.
Hi, I'm Jerry.
George, how you doing?
What did you do?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Oh yeah right, me neither. Hey I didn't do nothing!
Shut up.
Hot out.
Brutal.
What do you tip a chamber maid.
I don't know, five bucks a night.
No, a dollar, two tops.
Hey, you guys aren't cuffed. What are you, narks?
Narks?
Imagine, us narks?
No no no, you know actually we are friends of a serial killer.
Really? Well, that's very nice.
Oh, thank you.
Suspected serial killer, he didn't actually do it.
Yeah well, we don't think.
We're pretty sure.
A dollar a night?
Yeah, that's a good tip!
That stinks!
I read it in Ann Landers.
Oh, Ann Landers sucks!
Hey, shut it up back there.
Attention all units, attention all units, all units code 3. All units in the area, code 3 in progress, 1648 North Bartholis, units required for assistance in apprehension of 702.
That's smog strangler.
Kramer.
Got him. Let's go.
I wanna see what's happening.
I don't know why I'm doing this.
Jerry, George!
You are under arrest in first degree murder and death of Ms Chelsea Lang.
Why did you do it? What possessed you?
I don't know...
Hey, how are you doing? Jerry! George!
We're doing fine. How are you?
What me? Fabulous, just fabulous. I've got a lot of auditions, a lot of call backs and I've got a lot of interest for my movie treatment. I'm in development, I'm in developed vehicles. And there's a lot of energy here, man. You know, the vibe, it's powerful. I'm just swept up at it. Yeah, I'm a player.
A player?
Yeah, a player...
Kramer, do you realize what's going on here? Do you know why you're here?
What? What this? I'll be out of here in couple of hours. Hey, guess who I met today? Rick Savage, oh nice kid, really good kid. You know, we're talking about doing a project together.
Kramer, you've been arrested as a serial killer!
So? I'm innocent! I mean you guys believe that I'm innocent, don't you? Jerry? George?
Well, yeah...sure.
Kramer, let's go. The Lieutenant wants to see you.
Ok, yeah. All right look, I'll be out of here by noon. Maybe we'll have lunch together, huh?
Help me!! Help me!
I didn't kill anyone, I swear! I swear to God!
Don't you ever swear to my God, Kramer. My God is the god who protects the innocent and punishes the evil scum like you, have you got that?
You're making a big mistake.
No! You have made the mistake, Kramer. Sickies like you always do. The only difference is that this time you're gonna pay.
What?
Now you might beat the gas chamber Kramer, but as long as I have got a breath in my body you will never ever see the light of day again.
Wow wow wow wow, you've got the wrong man!! It wasn't me!
Oh yeah, right. Maybe it was one of your other personalities huh, the wise guy, the little kid, the bellhop, the ball player, maybe the door to door vacuum cleaner salesman, but not you right? No, you wouldn't hurt a fly. You just couldn't help yourself, could you Kramer? You saw life brimming brightly with optimism and verve and you just had to snuff it out.
Ok, can I just talk to somebody? Can I just explain...
I'm not interested in your explanations, Kramer! Sure, I bet you've got a million of 'em. Maybe your mother didn't love you enough, maybe the teacher didn't call on you in school when you had your little hand raised, maybe the pervert in the park had a present in his pants, huh? Well, I've got another theory you're a weed.
No...
Society is filled with them. They're choking the life out of the all pretty flowers.
You see something even remotely pretty and you have to choke the life out if it, don't you Kramer?
You killed all the pretty flowers, didn't you Kramer? You killed the pretty little flowers, didn't you? You dirty, filthy, stinky weed! Didn't you?
Lieutenant, it's for you.
Martel...yeah...yeah...yeah...yeah.
What it is, Lieutenant?
Let him go.
What, but Lieutenant?
You heard me, let him go. They just found another body at the Laurel Canyon. Go on Kramer, get out of my sight.
Hey, how did you know about the guy in the park?
I said beat it!
Hahaa!
What?
What happened?
Somebody got killed while they had me in custody.
Really? Did you hear that? Somebody else was killed!
You're kidding? Somebody else got killed?
While you were in jail. So you're free.
Yes, I'm free. (singing) 'cause the murderer struck again!
So Kramer, what are you going to do?
Do? Do? Hey, I'm doing what I do. You know, I've always done what I do. I'm doing what I do, way I've always done and the way I'll always do it.
Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?
What do you want me to say? That the things haven't worked out the way that I planned? That I'm struggling, barely able to keep my head above water? That L.A. is a cold place even in the middle of the summer? That it's a lonely place even when your stuck in traffic at the Hollywood Freeway? That I'm no better than a screenwriter driving a cab, a starlet turning tricks, a producer in a house he can't afford? Is that what you want me to say?
I'd like to hear that.
Yeah...
Well, I'm not saying that! You know, things are going pretty well for me here. I met a girl...
Kramer, she was murdered!
Yeah, well I wasn't looking for a long term relationship. I was on TV.
As a suspect in a serial killing.
Ok, yeah, you guys got to put a negative spin on everything.
What did they put on this tuna? Tastes like a dill, I think it's a dill.
So you're not gonna come back to New York with us?
No no I'm not ready, things are starting to happen.
Taste this, is this a dill?
No, it's tarragon. Hey Kramer, I'm sorry about that whole fight we had about you having my apartment keys and everything.
Ok, it's forgotten.
Tarragon? Oh, you're crazy.
Well, take it easy.
Yeah, ok.
Yeah, take care. Stay in touch.
Hey hey, whoa come on give me a hug...
Oh, no...
No, you're crushing my sandwich.
Yeah, it's so nice when it happens to you.
Mint?
No thanks.
I've got to tell you, I'm really disappointed in Lupe.
It's been three days already, forget about Lupe.
Do you think she gets to take any of those little bars of soap home?
No, I don't.
You would think that at the end of the week when they hand out the checks, throw in a few soaps.
Yeah, maybe they should throw in a couple of lamps too.
I'll tell you something, if I'd own a company, my employees would love me. They'd have huge pictures of me up on the walls and in their home, like Lenin.
How much did you wound up tipping her?
Oh my God, I forgot!
Well, communism didn't work.
Hey!
Any mustard? This is empty.
Yeah, there's a new one in there.
No no, I don't like this one. It's too yellow. Any pickles?
Help yourself.
Yeah, all right.
Kramer, what are you doing here?
Getting something to eat.
Kramer, here!
Authorities exposed today, that the latest suspect in the smog strangling was apprehended this week on an unrelated charge, but somehow managed to escape from the police car, in which he was being held. Tobias Lehigh Nagy, who is also wanted in connection with a series of unrelated slains in the North West is still at large, his whereabouts unknown. He's described as 5'5" bald and reputedly a very generous tipper.
What did they do for toilet paper in the civil war?
What?
I wonder what toilet paper was loike in the 1860's. Did they carry it in rolls in their duffle bags?
Everything with you comes down to toilet paper.
What?
That's always the first question with you. Why is that always your focus?
All right, so what did they do?
I don't know. Maybe they gave out fig leaf clumps to all the soldiers.
Well I think it would be nice if there was some kind of historical record of it.
Maybe they should have a toilet paper museum. Would you like that? So we could see all the toilet paper advancements down through the ages. Toilet paper of the Crusades, the development of the perforation, the first six-pack . . .
Excuse me, Jerry? I'm Stu Chermak. I'm with NBC.
Hi.
Could we speak for a few moments?
Sure.
Hi, Jay Crespi.
Hello.
Uh, C-R-E-S-P-I?
That's right.
I'm unbelievable at spelling last names. Give me a last name.
Mm, I'm not-
George-
(backing off) Huh? All right, fine.
First of all, that was a terrific show.
Oh thank you very much.
And basically, I just wanted to let you know that we've been discussing you at some of our meetings and we'd be very interested in doing something.
Really? Wow.
So, if you have any idea for like a TV show for yourself, well, we'd just love to talk about it.
I'd be very interested in something like that.
Well, here, uh, why don't you give us a call and maybe we can develop a series.
Okay. Great. Thanks.
It was very nice meeting you.
Thank you.
Nice meeting you.
Nice meeting you.
What was that all about?
They said they were interested in me.
For what?
You know, a TV show.
Your own show?
Yeah, I guess so.
They want you to do a TV show?
Well, they want me to come up with an idea. I mean, I don't have any ideas.
Come on, how hard is that? Look at all the junk that's on TV. You want an idea? Here's an idea. You coach gymnastics team in high school. And you're married. And your son's not interested in gymnastics and you're pushing him into gymnastics.
Why should I care if my son's into gymnastics?
Because you're a gymnastics teacher. It's only natural.
But gymnastics is not for everybody.
I know, but he's your son.
So what?
All right, forget that idea, it's not for you....Okay, okay, I got it. You run an antique store.
Yeah and...?
And people come in the store and you get involved in their lives.
What person who runs an antique store gets involved in people's lives?
Why not?
So someone comes in to buy an old lamp and all of a sudden I'm getting them out of a jam? I could see if I was a pharmacist because a pharmacist knows what's wrong with everybody that comes in.
I know, but antiques are very popular right now.
No they're not, they used to be.
Oh yeah, like you know.
Oh like you do.
...And you're the manager of the circus.
A circus?
Come on, this is a great idea. Look at the characters. You've got all these freaks on the show. A woman with a moustache? I mean, who wouldn't tune in to see a women with a moustache? You've for the tallest man in the world; a guy who's just a head.
I don't think so.
Look Jerry, the show isn't about the circus, it's about watching freaks.
I don't think the network will go for it.
Why not?
Look, I'm not pitching a show about freaks.
Oh come on Jerry, you're wrong. People they want to watch freaks. This is a "can't miss."
Kramer.
Hello Newman.
Come on lets go. I got the helmet. Lets get the radar detector.
All right I'll be back in a second. You guys coming to my party? (exits)
Yeah, sure.
What's this all about?
We're making a trade. I'm giving him my motorcycle helmet - he's giving me his radar detector.
I didn't know you had a motorctcle.
Well my girlfriend had one.
You have a girlfriend?
I HAD a girlfriend and she was pretty wild.
I never remember you with a girl.
Nevertheless, ...
This is a pretty bad deal for Kramer. You know a radar detector is worth much more than that helmet. I think you're cheating him.
Don't say anything.
All right.
You know you're getting gypped over here.
Really, Ah,
We had a deal. Are you reneging out of the deal? Are you reneging? That's a renege.
Oh, stop saying 'reneging".
Well you're reneging.
I, Okay, okay. I'm not reneging.
All right give it to me. let go ...
You let go - come on ...(they fight over the items)
Gimme that - just gimme that. Here. Idiots!
Thanks buddy. So long he he ...(exits)
Does that thing work?
Nah.
... I just got a postcard from Elaine?
Really?
Yeah, they're in London now. They'll be back in a few weeks.
I can't believe she got involved with a shrink.
So, what's happening with the TV show? You come up with anything?
No, nothing.
Why don't they have salsa on the table?
What do you need salsa for?
Salsa is now the number one condiment in America.
You know why? Because people like to say "salsa." "Excuse me, do you have salsa?" "We need more salsa." "Where is the salsa? No salsa?"
You know it must be impossible for a Spanish person to order seltzer and not get salsa. (Angry) "I wanted seltzer, not salsa."
"Don't you know the difference between seltzer and salsa?? You have the seltezer after the salsa!"
See, this should be a show. This is the show.
What?
This. Just talking.
(dismissing) Yeah, right.
I'm really serious. I think that's a good idea.
Just talking? Well what's the show about?
It's about nothing.
No story?
No forget the story.
You've got to have a story.
Who says you gotta have a story? Remember when we were waiting for, for that table in that Chinese restaurant that time? That could be a TV show.
And who is on the show? Who are the characters?
I could be a character.
You?
Yeah. You could base a character on me.
So, on the show, there's a character named George Costanza?
Yeah. There's something wrong with that? I'm a character. People are always saying to me, "You know you're a quite a character."
And who else is on the show?
Elaine could be a character. Kramer..
Now he's a character. (Pause) So everybody I know is a character on the show.
Right.
And it's about nothing?
Absolutely nothing.
So you're saying, I go in to NBC, and tell them I got this idea for a show about nothing.
We go into NBC.
"We"? Since when are you a writer?
(Scoffs) Writer. We're talking about a sit-com.
You want to go with me to NBC?
Yeah. I think we really go something here.
What do we got?
An idea.
What idea?
An idea for the show.
I still don't know what the idea is.
It's about nothing.
Right.
Everybody's doing something, we'll do nothing.
So, we go into NBC, we tell them we've got an idea for a show about nothing.
Exactly.
They say, "What's your show about?" I say, "Nothing."
There you go.
(Nodding) I think you may have something there.
So, the show would be about my real life. And one of the characters would be based on you.
(Thinks) No, I don't think so.
What do you mean you don't think so?
I don't like it.
I don't understand. What don't you like about it?
I don't like the idea of a character based on me.
Why not?
well it just doesn't sit well.
You're my neighbor. There's got to be a character based on you.
That's your problem, buddy.
I don't understand what the big deal is.
Hey, I'll tell you what - you can do it on one condition.
Whatever you want.
I get to play Kramer.
You can't play Kramer.
I am Kramer.
But you can't act.
Phew!
Okay, fine. We'll use Newman.
Newman?
Use me for what?
Nothin' What do you want?
Well, you'll never guess what happened to me today. I was uh, driving ( Jerry and Kramer turn away) home on the palisades parkway when I looked in the rear view mirror and what did I see? The fuzz. And it's funny because my new radar detector was on. I didn't hear a thing. Isn't that strange?
Yeah. That's strange.
A radar detector, as I understand it, DETECTS RADAR! WITH A SERIES OF BEEPS AND FLASHING LIGHTS. But oddly, for some reason I didn't hear a thing except for the sound of a police siren.
That's queer uh?
I WANT MY HELMET BACK! GIVE ME BACK MY HELMET AND YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR THAT TICKET.
Yeah, you better think again Mojumbo.
You gave me a defective detector. ... Jerry?
Buyer beware.
Are you going to give me back that helmet or not?
No. We had a deal. There are no guarantees in life.
No, but there's karma, Kramer.
Karma Kramer?
And one more thing. I'm not coming to your party. (exits)
(To himself) Salsa, seltzer. Hey, excuse me, you got any salsa? No, not selzer, salsa. (George doesn't react) What's the matter?
(Nervous) Nothing.
You sure? You look a little pale.
No, I'm fine. I'm good. I'm very good.
What, are you nervous?
No, not nervous. I'm good, very good. (A beat, then he snaps) I can't do this! Can't do this!
What?
I can't do this! I can't do it. I have tried. I'm here. It's impossible.
This was your idea!
What idea? I just said something. I didn't know you were going to listen to me.
Dont' worry about it. They're just TV executives.
They're men with jobs, Jerry! They wear suits and ties. They're married, they have secretaries.
I told you not to come.
I need some water. I gotta get some water.
They'll give us water in there.
Really? That's pretty good.
Oh God, it's Joe Devola.
Who?
This guy's a writer, he's a total nut. I think he goes to the same shrink as Elaine.
Oh God he saw me.
Hello Jerry.
Hey Joe! HOW YOU DOING?
You're under no obligation to shake my hand.
Oh, no, Just a custom. Uh, THAT'S MY FRIEND GEORGE. YOU LOOK GOOD.
Why shouldn't I look good?
Oh, no reason. You're into karate right?
You want to hit me?
What are you doing here?
I dreopped a script off.
AH, GOOD FOR YOU.
Well, ...
You don't have to say anything.
No, Uh, hey I guess I'll see you Sunday night.
Why?
Kramer's party.
Kramer's ... having ... a ... party?
No, no, he's not having a party. He's doing something. I don't know what it is. It's nothing. He's not doing anything.
Gee, I thought Kramer and I were very close friends.
No, I'm sure you are. I'm sure you are very close friends. Very close.
Give my best to Hinckley.
What was that?
I can't believe what I just did. I didn't know kramer didn't invite him. I better call Kramer, ...
They're ready for you.
Okay, okay. Look, you do all the talking, okay?
Relax. Who are they?
Yeah, they're not better than me.
Course not.
Who are they?
They're nobody.
What about me?
What about you?
Why them? Why not me?
Why not you?
I'm as good as them.
Better.
You really think so?
No.
(To Jerry, laughing about one of his bits) The bit, the bit I really liked what were the parakeet flew into the mirror. Now that's funny.
The parakeet in the mirror. That's a good one, Stu.
Yeah, it's one of my favorites.
What about you, George? Have you written anything we might know?
(Quickly making it up) Well, possibly. I wrote an off-Broadway show, "La Cocina." ..Actually, it was off-off-Broadway. It was a comedy about a Mexican chef.
Oh, it was very funny. There was one great scene with the chef - what was his name?
Pepe.
Oh, Pepe. Yeah, Pepe. And, uh, he was making tamales.
Oh, he actually cooked on the stage?
No, no, he mimed it. That's what was so funny about it.
So, what have you two come up with?
Well, we've thought about this in a variety of ways. But the basic idea is I will play myself-
(Interrupting) May I?
Go ahead.
I think I can sum up the show for you with one word NOTHING.
Nothing?
(Smiling) Nothing.
(Unimpressed) What does that mean?
The show is about nothing.
(To George) Well, it's not about nothing.
(To Jerry) No, it's about nothing.
Well, maybe in philosophy. But, even nothing is something.
Mr. Dalrymple, your niece is on the phone.
I'll call back.
(Attempting to spell his last name) D-A-L-R-I-M-P-E-L?
(Obviously dislikes George) Not even close.
Is it with a "y"?
No.
What's the premise?
..Well, as I was saying, I would play myself, and, as a comedian, living in New York, I have a friend, a neighbor, and an ex-girlfriend, which is all true.
Yeah, but nothing happens on the show. You see, it's just like life. You know, you eat, you go shopping, you read.. You eat, you read, You go shopping.
You read? You read on the show?
Well, I don't know about the reading.. We didn't discuss the reading.
All right, tell me, tell me about the stories. What kind of stories?
Oh, no. No stories.
No stories? So, what is it?
(Showing an example) What'd you do today?
I got up and came to work.
There's a show. That's a show.
(Confused) How is that a show?
Well, uh, maybe something happens on the way to work.
No, no, no. Nothing happens.
Well, something happens.
Well, why am I watching it?
Because it's on TV.
(Threatening) Not yet.
Okay, uh, look, if you want to just keep on doing the same old thing, then maybe this idea is not for you. I, for one, am not going to compromise my artistic integrity. And I'll tell you something else, this is the show and we're not going to change it. (To Jerry) Right?
(To Russell) How about this I manage a circus..
I don't even want to talk about it anymore. What were you thinking? What was going on in your mind? Artistic integrity? Where, where did you come up with that? You're not artistic and you have no integrity. You know you really need some help. A regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you. You need to go to like Vienna or something. You know what I mean? You need to get involved at the University level. Like where Freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you. That's the kind of help you need. Not the once a week for eighty bucks. No. You need a team. A team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you, having conferences, observing you, like the way they did with the Elephant Man. That's what I'm talking about because that's the only way you're going to get better.
. . . I thought the woman was kind of cute.
Hold it. I really want to be clear about this. Are you talking about the woman in the meeting? Is that the woman you're talking about?
Yeah, I thought I might give her a call. I, I don't meet that many women. I meet like three women a year. I mean, we've been introduced. She knows my name.
IT'S COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE!
Why? Maybe she liked me. I, I mean she was looking right at me. You know, I think she was impressed. You know, we had good eye contact the whole meeting.
Oh, I forgot to call Kramer.
Wait a minute let me call Susan.
No, no this is more important.
She might be leaving to work any minute.
No, I got to warn him that I told Joe Devola about his party.
No.
What is it?
I was just thinking about this patient of mine.
What?
Just wondering if he's taking his medication.
Well, come on we're on vacation.
Well we were standing uh, inn the waiting area there, and you know how Devola is. He's all, ... (buzzer)
Yeah (to buzzer)
(OC) It's George.
And so, uh I felt very uncomfortable with him and you know I just blurted out something about your party.
Whoa, back up a second.
Well, I didn't know that you didn't invite him.
Why would you think I would invite him?
I just a ssumed, ...
Assumed? Never assume anything. I don't want that nut in my house. You know he's on medication.
Hello, oh, hello. You remember, ... Susan, from N B C.
Of course. How are you?
Fine, it's good to see you.
And this is Kramer.
Hello.
All right go ahead Susan, tell him.
Tell me what?
Well, I, (phone rings)
Uh, sorry, Excuse me one second. Hello.
Hi, would you be interested in switching over to TMI long distance service.
Oh, gee, I can't talk right now. Why don't you give me your home number and I'll call you later.
Uh, I'm sorry we're not allowed to do that.
Oh, I guess you don't want people calling you at home.
No.
Well now you know how I feel. (Hangs up)
Well, go ahead, tell him.
Kramer, are you drinking that milk?
Yeah.
What's the expiration date on that?
September third.
The third?
and SUSAN The third?
Um, Uh, ugh, ...
Noooo... (Kramer throws up on Susan)
I never should have brought her up there. Should have known better. Should have seen it coming. I didn't see it coming.
I think SHE saw it coming.
You know she was behind the idea. She was going to champion the show. That's what I was bring her up there to tell you. And she liked me.
Look just because Kramer vomited on her doesn't mean the deal is dead.
What, are you crazy? It's a traumatic thing to be thrown up on.
Vommiting is not a deal breaker. If Hitler had vommited on Chamberlin, Chamberlind still would have given him Chekoslovakia.
Chamberlind, you could hold his head in nthe toilet, he'd still give you half of Europe.
What happened to you?
Devola came after me.
What? Devola? See I told you this guy is crazy. I can't believe this. What happened?
Can I have a coffee. ... What, you know I was walking home and I had to pick up my helmet from the shop, you know. I gota new strap. And I had it on you know, and I was checking the strap out to make sure it fit. Then suddenly I feel this kick hit me on the side of the head. It knocks me down, I look up and it's Crazy Joe Devola. And he say's, "That's what I thin k of your party."
Boy, that is some kick.
Well, yeah, Newman's helmet, it saved my life. Look at that.
Wow, Newman's helmet.
Holly.
I got bad news for you buddy. Devola says you're next.
Me, why?
He doesn't like you.
What does he want from me? I didn't do anything. See this is all Elaine's fault. She took off to Europe with his psychiatrist. He probably can't get his medication. Now I got some nut after me.
Pass the cream.
Wait a second. (smells it). all right.
(going through couch cushions) Where the hell did I put this?
What are you looking for?
The remote, the remote, I can't find the remote. Did I lost, I lost it. Did you take it? Did you put it some place?
No, no, no.
All right, what is this?
(clueless) what is what?
All right, very funny. I get it.
You're in a weird mood.
Come on. Go back to your apartment and fix it.
Fix what?
Your pants!
what is this? What have I got one pant leg on for?
Don't you know? Look-look at your face! You only shaved the right side of your face! What is this? A joke?
No, t's a joke.. a joke... a joke... you think this is funny?
Go look at your face in the mirror.
Wha-huh-wha-huh...
(pressing intercom) yeah?
(on intercom) It's George.
Come on up.
I don't believe this.
You mean, you didn't know you were doing any of these things?
No, I swear.
I bet this is from that kick from that crazy Joe Davola. You better see a doctor and get some X-rays.
(to Kramer) Ah! You're just the man I'm looking for.
Me?
Yeah, here you go.
What's this?
A dry-cleaning bill?
From that woman at NBC?
Yeah.
A dry-cleaning bill for what?
For vomiting on her vest!
Oh, come on George! I didn't do that on purpose!
Well, I shouldn't have to pay for it!
Well, neither should I! Jerry's the one who left the milk in the refrigerator.
(to Jerry) Yeah, your milk.
(pointing Kramer) He drank it.
I didn't know.
All right, well, we should all chip in I guess.
Yeah.
How much was it to clean the vest?
Eighteen dollars.
Can you get vomit out of suede?
I don't know.
Yo-yo Ma!
What? Yo-yo Ma?
What about him?
You just said 'Yo-yo Ma'.
What's Yo-yo Ma?
He's a cellist. (to Kramer) You should see a doctor today.
All right, come on, come on, let's go. Six dollars.
I can't believe she sent you that dry-cleaning bill.
I know!
That doesn't really bode well for the show, does it?
The show! Forget about the show! We should take the idea to a different network
Oh, yeah. Right. Like anybody's ever gonna do this! How did you get me to go along with that? A show about nothing!
It was a good idea. Susan liked it. Now, if he hadn't vomitted all over her, we'd be writing it right now.
Jeez!
Anyway.
(interrupts) What are you doing? What's wrong with you? What're you doing? Give me that phone! Go to your apartment and lie down, I'll make an appointment for a doctor today. (on the phone) Hello? Oh hi! I'm sorry. No, that's my next door neighbor. He's not quite himself. He got kicked in the head. What? Really? You're kidding! Today? Yeah! Sure! We could make it. Two o'clock? Yeah, we would do that. Okay. Great! Thanks a million! Okay, bye.
What?
NBC! They wanna have another meeting about the idea.
They wanna have another meeting? They wanna buy it?! They wanna but it?! Oh! I tell you! We're gonna be rich!! What are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?
I don't know about sixty.
Oh, it's gotta be fifty! Hee hee! You know how much Ted Danson makes, huh?
Ted Danson! Now, how are you comparing us to Ted Danson?
I didn't say 'We're Ted Danson.'
Yes, you did. You said 'We're Ted Danson'!
Oh!
You know, I think he wears a piece.
Yeah, don't worry. He can afford it.
I'm ten minutes slow again! That's it for this piece of junk! I've had it.
What, is that the one your parents gave you?
Yeah! But it never works. You know we're supposed to be there by two o'clock. We should take a cab.
All right, we'll be a little late, I,m not taking a cab.
I'll pay for it.
It's not the money!
Well, what is it you object to? The comfort? The Speed? The convenience?
Jerry!
Uncle Leo!
Helloooo!
Hello there, how're you doing?
Ha ha! How are you?
Good, good.
How's your mom and dad?
Good, fine.
What are you getting to be too much of a big shot now to give me a call? I don't hear from you anymore!
Oh, no. I've been kinda busy. It's all.
You know where I just came from?
(not enthousiastic at all) Oh, sure. Danny.
He used to be in the pajama business. I used to be able to get pajamas for free. I used to come over and get pajamas all the time!
Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember.
The funny thing is I can't wear 'em. I get too hot. I sleep in my underwear and a t-shirt. If it gets too hot, I just get the t-shirt off! Anyway, Danny says to me 'You need any pajamas?'
(interrupts) I-I'm sorry Uncle Leo, I really gotta get going.
Oh. Well. You gotta get going, so go.
We, we got a big meeting with the president of NBC.
Nobody got a gun to your head!
(seems sincere) Yeah, I'm really sorry, uh.
Go. Really. I understand. You got an appointment, go to your appointment.
I'm sorry, really.
You know, I know plenty of people in Hollywood too!
Sorry, really.
(from inside) Yeah?
Come on, are you ready? Let's go!
For what?
What's the matter with you? I just talked to you fifteen minutes ago.
what about?
The courthouse. You gotta go with me to the courthouse. I'm contesting a ticket today.
I can't, I'm going to the doctor's later.
You gotta go with me. I mean, you-you're my alibi. You have to take the stand.
Well, I can't!
Well, let me remind you of something. You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me and my helmet. I saved your life! You would be dead! Dead! You would cease to exist! You would be gone for the rest of eternity! You wouldn't even begin to comprehend what that means!!
Shut up! I'll get my coat!
Don't step on anything.
You see the look on my uncle's face? Did you see how insulted he was? What could I do? Waht are we supposed to do? You can't leave. There's no excuse good enough to justify walking away from a conversation with one of my relatives.
I didn't shave this morning. I don't feel like myself.
You could be a fireman on a fire truck on the way to a fire. You bump into one of my relatives. 'I'm sorry Uncle Leo, there's a building full of people burning down. I really do have to be running.' He'll go 'Go. Go ahead. Go to your fancy fire. If that's what you have to do.'
Look at this.
Why didn't you shave this morning?
'Cause I shaved yesterday in the afternoon.
Why?
Because of the day before. It's a long story.
Is that Joe Davola?
It's not him!
I can't live tlike this. I'm being stalked.
Mister Seinfeld? They're ready for you.
Oh.
Mister Seinfeld? What about Mister Costanza? I'm not here?
All right. Look. Now, you promised you're gonna be a little more flexible on the nothing idea, okay? Jsut a little.
Okay. A little.
Okay, you're all set? You got your story?
No.
When the cop stopped me, I told him that I was rushing home because my friend was about to commit suicide.
Uhm...
Now, you're that firend. Now, all we need is a reason why you were going to commit suicide.
I never had an air conditioner.
No! That's no reason to kill yourself!
Why? It gets hot at night, you can't sleep. You ever tried to sleep in a really hot room?
Every night I sleep in a really hot room, I don't want to kill myself.
Well, I slept in really hot rooms and I wanted to kill myself.
No, no, no. That's not gonna work. Something else.
I was never able to become a banker.
Banker! So you're killing yourself because your dreams of becoming a banker have gone unfulfilled. You-you-you-you can't live without being a banker.
Yeah, yeah. If I can't be banker, I don't wanna live.
You must be banker.
MUST be banker.
Okay, we'll go with the banker story.
The story is the foundation of all entertainment. You must have a good story otherwise it's just masturbation.
And people really have to care about the characters.
Care? Forget about care. Love. They have to love the characters. Otherwise, why would they keep tuning in?
Wouldn't tune in.
Would they tune in?
No tune.
We like to look at the show as if it were in EKG. You have your highs and your lows and it goes up and down.
The show will be like a heart attack!
Just a huge massive coronary.
So what you said last week about no story, you're a little flexible on that now.
Is-is that what I said 'no story'? Because Jerry had to tell me later.
He couldn't believe it.
(Laughs, snorts) I said, I said 'Get outta here! No story? Is that what I said?'
Well, I informed him that he was exceeding the speed limit and uh, that's when he told me that he was racing home because his friend was about to commit suicide.
And then what happened?
Well, then he became very loud and hysterical. He was flailing his arms about as he told the story and then he threw himself on the ground and he grabbed me around the legs and then he begged me to let him go. And when I refused, that's when he began to scream 'My friend's going to die, my friend's going to die.'
Look. I don't know how you two guys feel but we would really like to be in business with you.
Well, we would like to be in business. Let's do business. We'll have some business. Let's have business.
We would love to be in business. We'll do business. We're in business. It's... it's business. This is business.
Yeah!
Would it be possible to get a-a-a copy of 'La Cocina'?
Your off-Broadway play.
Oh, oh. Uh, you know. It's the damndest thing. I, uh, I moved recently and my files, pfff, disappeared. Now, I-I don't know if they fell off the truck or if there was some sort of foul play but let me tell you something. I'm not through with that moving company.
(backs his story) Hmm, hmm.
That's my vow to you.
Well, I got a feeling about you two. And even more than that. I place a great deal of confidence in that lady's judgment.
Oh! That's good judgment. That's a pile of judgment there. Sure.
Oh! Taht's judgment. Yes, yes. Judgment with earrings on. Yeah.
(gets up) So, let's make a pilot.
I had gone up to Westchester. I go there every Tuesday. I do charity for the blind in my spare time for the Lighthouse. I was in the middle of a game of Parcheesi with an old blind man and I excused myself to call my friend as he was very depressed lately because he never became a banker.
I don't understand.
You see, it'd been his lifelong dream to be a banker and he uh, just the day before he was turned down by another bank. I believe it was the Manufacturer's Hanover on Lexington and 40th Street. That was the third bank to turn him down so I was-I was a little concerned. I wanted to see how he was doing. Well, Your Honor, he was barely audible. But I distinctly recall him say...
(interupts involuntarily) Yo-yo Ma!
So I sped home to save my friend's life and I was stopped for speeding. Yes, I admit I was speeding but it was to save a man's life. A close friend. An innocent person who wanted nothing more out of life than to love, to be loved and to be a banker.
So then he didn't kill himself.
No sir. He did not. But only by thge grace of God. He's in the courtroom today
See?
Yeah!
I told you, I told you! Ha ha ha! Ooh ooh!
Now, all we gotta do is write it.
Yes! How're we gonna do that?
Hey! Congratulations!
Thanks.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, thanks.
Thanks. Gee, you know, I thought you were mad at me.
No.
Mister Seinfeld, you have a phone call.
Phone call? Who knows I'm here?
When you sent me the-the bill for the dry-cleaning. I thought the show didn't have a chance.
Oh, it was only vomit.
Anyway, I-I would like to-to pay for the cleaning.
Oh no-no, it's okay. *comment from transcriber yeah, she doesn't want to be paid, didn't she send the bill?*
No-no-no, we all chipped in. We have the money.
Well, it was eighteen dollars.
Okay, uh, eighteen dollars, and there it is. There you go. So maybe we could get together this weekend.
Yeah. Call me.
All right, great.
Bye.
Bye thanks.
(chuckles) Bye, thanks. (To Jerry, when Susan is far) I can't believe she took the money.
Why?
I offered to pay. She should've said no.
She did, you insisted.
Maybe this is what the pilot should be about, vomiting on somebody's vest.
Nah!
How much are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?
oh, I d-I don't know. I d---
Oh, gotta get fifty. Gotta get fifty. All right, I tell you what. We go to the coffee shop, you call your manager. Maybe they made an offer.
Okay.
(excited, pushing Jerry forward) All right, let's go, let's go, let's go, come on.
Thirteen thousand?
Thirteen thousand.
a piece?
No, for both!
That's insulting! Ted Danson makes eight hundred thousand dollars an episode.
Oh, would you stop with the Ted Danson?
Well, he does.
You're nuts!
I'm sorry. I can't live knowing Ted Danson makes that much more than me. Who is he?
He's somebody.
What about me?
You're nobody.
Why him? Why not me?
He's good, you're not.
I'm better than him.
You're worse, much much worse. (crouches in booth) That's Davola!
(crouches too) What? Where? Where?
Outside! I saw him outside!
what is it?
Oh, it's this patient.
(sighing) Again?
I'm fairly certain. I forgot to leave him an extra prescription for his medication.
Well, so, he can live without his Valium for a couple of days.
Nah, you don't understand. He could be dangerous.
Go outside and see if he's still there.
I can't go out there, he knows we're friends.
Well, what are we supposed to do? I gotta take Kramer to the doctor.
Tell the cop.
Good idea.
Yeah, all right. Just let me get a muffin.
Thanks.
(back in booth) He's gonna get a muffin and then he'll walk us outside. This is a great way to go through life.
I thought you said he was gonna get a muffin.
(bossy) What are you doing?
What?
What, are you ordering food now?
Yeah! Yeah, I decided to get a sandwich.
What happened to the muffin?
I got a little hungry.
All of a sudden you get hungry?
Yeah! You got a problem with that?
No! Enjoy your lunch.
I thought he was just gonna have a muffin.
All of a sudden he gets hungry.
You know, a muffin can be very filling.
I know!
(interrogating Kramer) Mister Kramer, you heard the testimony so far. Would you please tell the court in your own words what happened on the afternoon of September 10th?
What do you mean 'my own words'? Whose words are they gonna be?
You know what I mean.
(to Judge) I was very upset that day.
And why was that?
(to Newman) Would you let me say it? Let me talk!
All right, all right. Go ahead, go ahead.
All right.
Okay.
(to Judge) I was very upset that day because I could never become a banker.
And that failure to become a banker was eating at you. Eating-eating-eating at you inside.
(not convincing) Uh, yeah.
It was your family that pushed you into banking , it was their dream for you...
Mister Newman.
Your Honor, I'm only trying to establish Mister Kramer's fragile emotional state, my entire case depends on it.
Uh, continue.
As you were saying, Mister Kramer...
What was the question?
You're telling how your parents pushed you into banking.
Uh, well, my father when I was a kid, he took me to the bank and he lifted me up and he pointed to the teller and he said 'Sonny boy, take a good look at him, that's gonna be you some day.'
But you never became a banker, did you Mister Kramer? Why? Why did you fail?
I don't know.
It was because you hated your father and you would do anything to displease him. Isn't THAT true?
Uh, could you get to the speeding?
Yuh, yes. I intend to Your Honor. And then, on the afternoon of September 10th, you received a phone call did you not?
(puzzled) Phone call?
Yes, a phone call!
From who?
From me!
From you?
Yes, from me!! I called you remember?
You called me?
Yes, I called you, you idiot! Because you were going to... You were going to... Remember?
what?
You were going to...
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to call a---
Yes, the banker!!!
What banking?
A banker! A banker! Your Honor, Your Honor, Your Honor...
That's enough already.
Your Honor, Mister Kramer's obviously very distraught.
I'm distraught!?! Wooh-wooh-hoo!
(to Kramer) You shut up! (to judge) I demand a recess so I can take him outside and help him regain hius composure.
That'll be seventy-five dollars.
(Strangling Kramer) What's the matter with you? We had it all worked out!
Do you see him?
I'm not* sure.
Well, either you see him or you don't.
All right. I don't.
(looking at the cop) What is he doing? Is he getting coffee? I think he's getting coffee.!
What's with this guy?
(still bossy) Did you just order coffee?
Yeah.
This is really too much.
What is your problem?
Well, I'm sitting over there waiting for you to finish your sandwich for twenty minutes. Now you're drinking coffee, that's gonna be another ten minutes.
Well, you're just gonna have to wait.
Never said anything about the banking.
You're off your rocker.
Hey you guys!
Hey!
What are you doing here?
What are YOU doing here?
Hey, is Davola outside?
Davola?
Yeah.
No, I didn't see him.
Crazy Joe Davola?
(reading the tabs) Jerry, yours is eleven dollars.
Eleven dollars for what?
Muffin, sandwich and coffee!
(to Kramer) Hey, NBC okayed our idea. We're gonna make the pilot.
You're gonna do the circus freak show, uh?
No.
Pilot? So what do you make for something like that? Fifty? Sixty thousand?
What's the difference? The money is not important.
(looking outside) Hey Newman, is that your red car?
Yeah.
I think you're getting a ticket.
Deh!
Run, run! Go, go, go!
Hey! What are you doing? It's after six o'clock! You can't give me a ticket! Hey, you're not gonna get away with this. I'll fight this. I got witnesses.
I saw the whole thing!
Maybe this whole thing would be a good idea for the pilot.
Ah, get outta here. The vomiting is much funnier.
Oh, like you know what you're talking about!
No, YOU do!
So George and I went up to NBC and we told them the idea for a series now we're just waiting to sign the contract.
And they liked the idea?
Yeah.
What'ya got leather seats here?
Since when is George a writer?
What writer? It's a sitcom.
This is so exciting. When are you going to sign the contract?
Soon, there's a couple of problems.
Jerry, I wanna tell you that meal was the worst.
What do you expect? It's airline food.
They give you that *Fish.*
How could you eat fish on a plane?
because she puts up such a big stink every time I have a piece of meat.
What kind of problems?
Well, George doesn't think $13,000 is enough money.
What? He's not even working.
George is right. Those people will try to get away with murder. Believe me. They're all crooks.
Jerry, I want you to sign that contract.
We're going to sign it. We're going to sign it. In fact George is out with the woman from NBC right now.
So, I'm uh, I'm afraid we're going to have to pass.
Yu - you're passing?
Well, it's . . . much too low.
Are you and Jerry in complete agreement on this?
tsh (snorts) Ah, yeah, we've - we've talked . . . I believe I can speak for the both of us on this.
Well be-because you know that, because this is your first show it's a pretty standard deal.
Standard?
Yeah.
Is Ted Danson's deal standard?
Ted Danson?
You know, the guy from Cheers.
Yeah, I know who he is. (laughs) You're not Ted Danson.
I didn't say I was Ted Danson.
All right, I'll tell Russell tomorrow.
You tell Russell.
Oh, um, before I forget, . . . Cuban cigars. It's a present from my father.
Oh... do I have to write him a note or something?
Yeah, I am sure he'd appreciated that.
Well what would I say in the note?
Ah, you're a writer. You'll think of something.
Oh-ohf (snorts) yeah, I'm a writer. (laughs)
Were you waiting long at the gate?
Um, I don't even know?
Where's that watch we bought you?
Oh uh ...
That's enough with this piece of junk I've had it. (throws watch in garbage)
Wha-Is that the one your parents gave you?
Yeah, but it never works.
. . . it's uh, being fixed.
I got a guarantee on that watch. Give it to me, I'll take it back to where we got it.
It's at the jeweler.
You send me the bill.
I'm not sending you the bill.
That watch was a gift. You shouldn't have to pay for it.
That's uh, $18.50.
Here, I got it.
What are you talking about? It's my car. Let me pay for the gas.
No, no put it away . . .
Dad!
Stop it.
I have money. I make money.
Yeah, yeah, you make money.
You don't think I make money. That's what you think isn't it?
No, I don't think that.
Yes you do. That's what you both think.
I'm paying.
Dad I'm paying.
Get out of here.
You're not paying.
Now Jerry please, do not do this to your father. Over my dead body Jerry. I'll tell you right now, you're not going to do it.
No don't do this. You're not doing this. I will fight you. No you don't... No.
Boy, you got a lot of stuff here. . . . Dad, what are you doing?
Nothing nothing.
Leave it. What about your back?
Morty, what are you doing?
All right, all right.
You come all the way up here to see a back specialist and you're lifting heavy suit cases.
Hey, Morty.
Hey, Mr. Kramer. Ha ha ha.
Hey, Mrs. Seinfeld. Hi
Ha, ha, ha Oh, What happened to you?
Oh, ah, well some guy kicked me in the side of the head.
What guy?
Ah, w-Crazy Joe Devola.
Why?
Well, I was having this party and I didn't invite him and then Jerry, tipped him off.
Why did you tell this crazy guy that Kramer didn't invite him to his party?
I didn't know he wasn't invited.
Hey, these are very comfortable pants. You know what I paid for these Jerry?
So why did you say anything?
It was a mistake.
They're good around the house -- and they're good for outside.
Are you okay?
Oh, yeah, yeah. I was a little off last week, huh Jerry -- Yeah but the doctor says it was just a slight concussion
So what's the matter with this Devola guy?
He's got like a chemical imbalance. He needs to be on medication.
Oh, yeah, yeah. He's after Jerry now.
Kramer!!
He's what?!
He's joking.
He's after you?
Nooo.
Why is he after you?
He's not after me.
Morty, do you here this? Some crazy guy is after Jerry.
I'll make a few phone calls.
Who you gonna to call?
What are you worried about?
I want to know what you did to this guy that he's after you.
I didn't do anything.
Well you must have done something.
No, he just doesn't like me.
Doesn't like you? How could anyone not like you?
You know it seems impossible.
Doesn't - doesn't like you? How could that be?
Ma, I know this may be hard for you to understand but I am sure there are many people who do not like me.
Huh, Jerry, don't say that.
It's true.
No, it isn't! it's not true. You're a wonderful, wonderful boy. Everybody likes you. It's impossible not to like you. Impossible. Morty?
Maybe some people don't like him. I could see that.
Kramer?
Yeah, I like him. Hey Jerry, what time you got?
Um, I haven't got my watch on. It's being fixed.
When you getting it back?
Uh, next week.
Next week? How come it's takin' so long?
Huh?
I said how come it's takin' so long?
I don't know. They're, backed up.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, where did you take it?
Where'd I take it?
Yeah.
Where did I take it? Where Did I Take It? (stabbing a knife into a cutting board) Umm, to that place on, uh Columbus and 85th. Okay?
What? Jimmy Sherman?
Yeah.
Yeah, I know the guy. I take my stuff in there all the time. Yeah, I bet I can get your watch back by tomorrow morning.
No, Kramer, I don't want you to say anything to him.
No, I'd be happy to. He's a friend of mine.
I'd like to follow the regular procedures. I don't want any special treatment.
Hey, I'm going to get that watch back for you by tomorrow, buddy. You see.
Bring me the receipt.
I get that too. (exits)
Be right back. (follows Kramer out)
There's no watch ... I threw it in the garbage can on the street. It didn't keep good time. My parents gave it to me, but I didn't like it. So don't mention it again, okay!
Y-Yeah, all right.
All right.
Wait, wait, . . .y-yea, w-no dit dit g- (Kramer noises)
What was that about?
Oh, no, uh, he's got my Calamine lotion and uh, I told him not to return it. If he needs it he should keep it. He's got uh, he's got a thing on his ankle.
How can anyone not like him.
Hi, Morty Seinfeld. I have a two o'clock appointment.
Yes, Mr. Seinfeld. Would you please fill this out.
All this? This whole thing? It's going to take me forty-five minutes.
I know. It's very long.
Look at this. It's a book. Employer's address. Whydo they need this? You know I never had a back problem until that night I slept on the convertible sofa. (hu hu) My back was fine.
Well, it's not the sofa.
You stick up for that sofa like I'm criticizing a person.
We got it from Sullivan's. It's a good store.
Well one day somebody's going to sleep on that thing and we'll get sued. I hope this doctor knows what he's doing.
Leo says he's the best there is.
Leo, I'm listening to Leo now!
Well you're lucky he was able to get you this appointment. You know what the waiting list is for this guy?
Well, if he fixes my back I'll be happy. . . . (back to the form) Have you ever had a sexually transmitted disease? That's IT! . . . Here, you got my name, you got my address. That's enough.
Julie, you want to take him back?
You what? You passed? How could you do that?
ahhhhh (exhaling) Jerry, my young friend, you're so nave. You are so, so nave. You know about a few things. You know about comedy, a little bit about relationships, some baseball, but you are so far out of your element here, you are embarrassing yourself. Now listen to me. I'm negotiating. Negotiation, this is what'cha do in business.
Let me explain to you what you just did. There are literally hundreds of people trying to get pilot deals with them this year. They go with maybe, five. Okay, if we pass, that's it. They go to the next show.
Ooooo, I'm scared. . . . Ohoooo they're not going to do the show.
We're lucky they're even interested in the idea in the first place. We got a show about nothing. With no story. What do you think, they're up there going, hey maybe we should give those two guys, who have no experience and no idea, more money!?
Ohooo what are we going to do? I'm shaking! I'm shaking!
Well, I think you're wrong.
Well, we'll just see.
Yes we will.
Yes we will.
I just said that.
I know you did.
So good for you.
So good for you.
What are you repeating everything I'm saying?
What are you repeating everything I'm saying?
Well George is an idiot.
Well George . . . .
All right, all right, Let's go already. They keep you in here a year. They don't give a damn. I could die in here. . . .(open the door and shouts into the hallway) Excuse me! Excuse me! What's going on? I'm here twenty minutes. Could somebody please help me.
(enters) Shhh. Quiet! Everyone can hear you.
Twenty minutes. I've been waiting twenty minutes.
Well the doctor must be busy.
Well then what do they make appointments for if they can't keep them. Huh, hha. Look if I did that in my business I wouldn't have made a nickel.
Hello, Mr. Seinfeld.
I thought you forgot about me.
We didn't forget.
HaAhhh! The Velcro. I can't stand Velcro. It's that t-e-a-r-I-n-g sound. I used to be in raincoats. I refused to put that in any of my lines.
Okay, Mr. Seinfeld, please come this way. We need some X-rays.
Leave all my stuff here?
Leave it.
Oh hey, by the way. Do you want a box 'a, Cuban cigars? I smoked one last night. I got nauseous.
No I don't want ?em.
I'll take it. No, I'll take it. What is it?
Here you go.
Cigars? (hits the box)
Yeah, Cubans.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, the kind that Castro smoked. You can't buy ?em anywhere.
Castro eh? Pasto costillo homiga (nonsense Spanish)
Yeah?
Federal Express.
Federal Express? Come on up. . . . Federal Express. I'm not expecting a package.
Wooo, you know what you just did? You let a burglar in the building.
You think so?
Federal Express? Of course. That's the oldest trick in the book. You know it might not be a burglar it could be a murderer.
So you want to just abolish all home package deliveries.
Yes. It's dangerous.
wait det doit ... dit (Kramer noises -- he prepares for a fight by rolling up a magazine)
Who is it?
Federal Express.
Okay, ... gidg gi gt (backs up and bends his knees, holding the rolled magazine - arm back, ready for a rumble)
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!
I want one of those!
Hiiii Kramer
Oh yes
Kramer, Hi, I thought you went to California.
Well I came back for you.
Oh, shut up (pushes Kramer)
I missed you.
Really? You really missed me?
Yeah, . . . seriously.
Yeah, yeah, me to miss -- I miss.
Yeah, big missing goin' on (spreads arms wide)
Ahhhhhh haa ha ha
Hey, I'm going to be right back. I'm going to get a match.
Oh god, Who's suitcase is this?
Oh, it's my parents. My father came up to see a back specialist.
Oh, god, it's probably from sleeping on that sofa.
Boy, you look really great.
Yeah.
You lie.
No, no you really look great.
Hu hu, ha ha ha.
So tell us about the trip. How's Dr. Reston?
Oh, he's fine.
Things are good?
Yeah, you know (scratches cheek and sniffs)
Uh oh.
What, Uh oh?
Did you see that?
Yeah, I saw it.
What?
It's a tell. You gotta tell.
What tell? What's a tell?
When you ask someone about their relationship and they touch their face, you know it's not going too well. Go ahead ask me how it's going with somebody.
Um, uh, who's it going with, uh, Alice?
Good, going good (scratches chin) And the higher up on the face you go the worse the relationship is getting. You know it is like - pretty good - not bad - I gotta get out. (scratches chin, nose then covers eyes with hands)
How high did I go?
You almost did the nose.
What are you eating my peanut butter out of the jar with your disgusting index fingers? This is a sickening display. (takes the peanut butter jar away from George)
What? I'm not eating bread now. I'm off bread.
(To George) You're off bread. (To Elaine) So what happened is it over?
No not quite.
Why not?
Well he was my psychiatrist, you know. I mean, he knows all my patterns. He knows In relationships that I always try to find some reason to leave, and so, he says as my doctor, he can't allow me to do this, so he's not letting me leave.
What do you mean - "Not letting you?"
He has this power over me, okay. I mean he has this way of manipulating every little word that I say. He's like a Svenjolly.
Svengali.
What did I say?
Svenjolly.
Svenjolly? I did not say Svenjolly.
George?
Svenjolly. (licking a little bit of peanut butter from his finger)
I don't see how I could have said Svenjolly.
Well maybe he's got like a, cheerful mental hold on you.
You know I can't find a match anywhere.
You know what you should do? You should tell this guy you're seeing somebody else. That's the easiest way to get out of these things.
No, it's not going to work with this guy.
No, you just tell him ah, an old boyfriend has come back into your life.
I don't think so.
Nice try.
Took a shot.
This is a good cigar (hair is on fire, white smoke pouring from the back of his head) . . . . . . WOOOOOOOOOOW . . . (runs to bathroom, his arms in the air -- he bangs them in to the top of the hallway door jam and falls into the bathroom)
So, when do I get to see the doctor?
He'll be in with the X-Rays in a few minutes. You can get dressed. (leaves)
(checking pants) They stole my wallet. The bum stole my wallet. (opens door, shouts into the hallway) MY WALLET'S GONE! MY WALLET'S GONE! I had my wallet in my back pocket. It's gone.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure. I went in to get my X-Ray, Somebody takes my wallet. Is that the operation here?
Mr. Seinfeld, I'm Dr. Dembrow, I've been going over your X-rays.
I'm not interested in the X-Rays. I want my money back. Somebody stole my wallet. I had $225 in there.
Well, I don't see how something like that could have happened.
Oh, you don't see. You don't see. Well it happened. Believe me.
(enters) What's going on?
They stole my wallet.
What?
Yeah, while I was in getting X-Rayed.
All right, Mr. Seinfeld, I am sorry about your wallet but would you like me to look over these X-Rays?
What kind of clip joint are ya running here?
All right, fine. (leaves)
The least you could have done was heard your diagnosis.
I am not interested in his diagnosis. He's a bum.
You came all the way from Florida to see him.
I want to know what kind of an office this is where you can't leave your pants in the room. You tell me.
I'm sorry but there's somebody else.
Umm hm.
Well it's, nothing I planned on happening, you know. It just, kind of happened.
Tell me about him.
Well, there's not really much to tell, you know, he's just a guy, Really.
Yes, well I assumed he's a guy.
Right...
And you've known him how long?
. . . Years. Many years (her voice cracks), um, (clears throat) we've been close friends and then recently something just you know *ehghh* happened.
You mean sexually?
Yeah, yeah. Sexu-ally.
I think your um ... (points at the phone)
Excuse me. Yes, Oh yes, Bobo. Uh, no it's just east of Madison. Around 400 will be fine. All right Bobo ... see you then. (hangs up) . . . I'm sorry where were we?
Well, I was just um, telling you about this, other guy.
Mm. Elaine ...
Yeah
Do you remember your dream, where you have a sexual encounter with a Chinese woman?
Yeah. Yeah, (cough, cough) Mm-hm.
Elaine, I'm concerned about you.
Oh, no no no no, don't concern yourself with me, because I'm - I'm good. I'm - I'm very good, I mean I'm really very, very good.
Elaine. Have you been urinating a lot again?
. . . no.
And how often have you been seeing, um . . .? I'm sorry what is his name?
H-his name?
Yes, his name.
Um, well what's the difference?
Are you afraid to tell me his name?
No, no, I just - I just don't see how that's relevant.
It doesn't matter if you don't see how. I see how.
Uh, his name, um, I don't - I don't even know, all right you want to know his name? I'll - I'll tell you his name. His name is . . . Kramer.
Kramer. Is that his first name or his last name?
Oh, I'm - I'm really uncomfortable talking about this.
Elaine, I want you to do me a favor.
What?
I want you to tell this young man to give me a call. It's very important that I speak to him.
Oh, oh no, no no no, I can't do that.
You can do it and you will do it.
No, I can't.
You can and you will.
Okay, okay. Yeah I'll have Kramer give you a call.
So you didn't even let the doctor treat you?
I wouldn't give him the satisfaction.
Why did you leave your wallet in your pants?
What are you talking about? What was I supposed to hide it somewhere?
You could've taken it with you.
Oh, yeah, I'll be lying on an X-Ray table with my wallet in my mouth.
Hello...
Hi Uncle Leo.
I just talked to Dr. Dembrow's son. He said they almost had to call the police.
What are you talking about? I'm the one who should have called the police. They stole my wallet.
You know how hard it was for me to get that appointment for you? You can't just walk in on this guy. He did me a personal favor.
All right, Leo.
And you walked out without paying.
How was I supposed to pay? I didn't have my wallet.
Well, I hope you send him a check.
What for?
What for? This man was nice enough to see you. He did me a personal favor.
That's the second time you said "personal favor". Why do you keep saying that?
I said it once.
Twice! And Dembrow doesn't even know you. His son happens to live on your floor.
Leo, where did you get that watch?
You know where I got this? (flashback) I found it in the garbage can. It kept terrible time. I brought it over to Jimmy Sherman right here on 85th and Columbus. Gave it to me back the next day. Works great. What kind of idiot throws a way a perfectly good watch?
Morty, doesn't that watch look like the one that we gave Jerry.
Hey, where's the waiter. Dad, what say we have some red meat tonight. Let's live a little. .
Let me see that.
Could we continue this another time.
George turns down the offer from NBC for the show, telling Jerry he's negotiating. Susan gives George a box of Cuban cigars from her father, which hepasses to Kramer, who sets fire to his hair while lighting one. Jerry's parents come to town, so's Morty can see a back specialist - he slept on the fold-out. Kramer tells Jerry's parents that Crazy Joe Davola is after Jerry. Jerry throws away a watch his parents gave him, because it doesn't keep time. Uncle Leo fetches it out of the garbage. Jerry tells his parents his watch is at the jeweller for repair. At the doctor's, Morty reveals his hatred of velcro and his wallet disappears. Elaine returns from Europe, eager to rid herself of the 'Svenjolly' Dr Reston. George tells her to inform the doctor she's seeing someone else. Elaine opts to say she's seeing Kramer, and Dr Reston wants to meet him.)
It's an entire industry of bad gifts, aren't they? All those executive gifts, any stupid, goofy, brass, wood thing, they put a piece of green felt on the bottom. "It's a golf, desk, tie and stress organiser, dad." But to me, nothing compares with the paperweight as a bad gift. There's no better way than a paperweight, to express to someone that, "I refuse to put any thought into this at all." Where are these people working that the papers are just blowing right off of their desks? What, are their desks screwed to the back of a flat-bed truck going down the highway or something? What, are they typing up in the crow's nest of a clipper ship? What do you need a paperweight for?
(to Leo) I don't understand this jeweller, Jimmy Sherman. (indicates Jerry) He brings in a watch, it takes over a week to fix. He fixed yours in one day.
Oh, you know these jewellers, they're enigmas. They're mysteries, wrapped in a riddle.
(indicating to Jerry) She's very attractive.
She's okay.
Just okay?
She's nice.
She's better than nice.
She's all right.
She's beautiful.
She's not beautiful.
I think she's beautiful.
So you ask her out.
I'm not gonna ask her out.
Why not?
If you don't think she's beautiful, there's something wrong with you.
She's pretty. She's not beautiful.
I should drop dead if she's not beautiful.
I think that's a little extreme.
(grudgingly) She's awright.
(oblivious to the above) Two exact same watches. He tells you a week, and him a day. How could that be? Something's fishy about this.
He said what?
"The hell with them."
"The hell with them?"
Those were his exact words.
(worried) Oh boy.
He said, "We've got five hundred shows to choose from. Why should we give two guys, who have no idea, and no experience, more money?"
(still worried) He was pretty emphatic?
Pounded on his desk.
Pounded?
(tossing her purse on the dash) I told you to take the offer.
(getting animated) Look I, I uh, I had nothing to do with this. It wasn't my decision. It was Jerry! Jerry told me no. I'm the creative guy. He handles the business end.
You said it was insulting.
I was quoting him. Why would I be insulted? I'm never insulted. You could call me baldy, dump soup on my head. Nothing insults me.
Well, there's nothing I can do.
Well, don't they make a counter offer? How can they just cancel the whole deal like that? What kind of a maniac is this guy? I mean he just, he says no, and that's it?
Yeah, that's the way Russell is. He doesn't like to play games.
Well, he has to play! He can't just not play. We're playing! Look, I gotta see him, how do I get in touch with him?
You'll have to wait til Monday.
Mon...? No, no, I can't wait til Monday, that's impossible, I gotta talk to him now. Where does he live?
(laugh) I can't give you his address.
Give it back!
Gimme the purse!
Okay, so he just wants to talk to you. I couldn't talk him out of it. So you just tell him that you're my boyfriend and that we're in love, okay. Can you do that?
Yeah, yeah, okay. I'm your boyfriend.
Okay.
Have we been intimate?
Yeah. Yeah, we've been intimate.
Alright, how often do we do it?
Kramer, how is that important? Honestly, do you really think he's gonna ask you that?
Elaine, he's a psychiatrist. They're interested in stuff like that.
Alright, alright. We do it, uh... (thinks) five times a week, okay?
(suggestive) Oooh, baby. (smiles)
Oh, man. Alright, listen. Just tell me something, what are you gonna say?
I know what I'm gonna say.
No, no, but I would like to hear it.
No, no. I don't wanna say it out loud. Kills the spontaneity. You know, Gleason, he never rehearsed. (indicates phone) 'Kay, go 'head, do it.
(dialling) Alright, okay. You talk to him.
(playing with his hair) Talk to him.
Hey, how's your hair?
Oh, well, yeah, it's good.
(handing over the phone) You're not the type that should be playing with matches, seriously Kramer.
(listens) Uh, yes. Uh uh, Doctor uh, Reston, is he in? Well, this is Kramer and uh, he's expecting my call.
(mouths silently) Okay.
(singing) ...Johnny ...was a rebel. He rode through the land...
...Yu uh, yes, yes uh, uh, Doctor Reston. Uhm well, hello there. Ahh yeah, well, I'm a good friend of Elaine's...
(animated, but quietly) No, no. Not friends.
...Well, actually uh, we're uh, we're not friends Uh, we're uh, we're much more than friends...
...and uh, I'm afraid we have a bit of a problem. Well, the point is, doctor uh, I'm very much in love with Elaine...
...and uh, she's very much in love with me, and uh, well uh, we would uh, appreciate it if you would cease and desist, and allow us to pursue our courtship unfettered.
(mouths silently) That's perfect!
If not, I can assure you, doctor, that I can make things very unpleasant for you and your staff. If you have one.
Yes. Yeah, but the point that I... (listens)
...Ah, ye... (listens) Well, no... Uh, yeah, that's possible...
(listens) ...Well, I suppose I could, (turns away from Elaine) but I'd have to shift a few things around, uhm... Hold on for a second, will you? Uh...
... Uh, go ahead, yeah. (listens and makes a note) Alright uh... Yeah, yeah, okay... I look forward to it too. (listens) Eh, hah, okay. So long.
What happened? What'd he say? (indicates pad) What's going on here?
Uh, okay now. He uh, you know, he uh, wants to get together.
(horrified) Get together!!
He wants to talk.
Well, why didn't you say no!!
(momentary confusion) Wha...? Uh... (thoughtful) That's interesting.
(frustration) Ugh!
Did you enjoy your poisson?
It was... different.
(to Jerry) And how was yours?
Ah, very good.
You should try our mousse. (a little flirtatious) It'll change your life expectancy.
No thanks, just the check.
What's the matter with you?
What?
Why didn't you flirt with her?
Come on.
She was flirting with you. Why didn't you say something?
What am I gonna say?
You just sat there.
Well, you made me uncomfortable.
You're a comedian, couldn't you come up with something?
(to Morty) Where's the bathroom?
In the back, on your right.
Dad!
Will you stop it Jerry. Let go.
Jerry.
Will you let me pay just once.
You're out of your mind.
How you gonna pay? You don't even have a wallet!
Don't worry about it.
What're you gonna do?
What's the difference, we'll figure something out.
(to Jerry) You're not paying.
Alright, fine. You figure something out. I'd be very curious to know how you pick up a check with no money. 'Cause if this works, the whole monetary system's obsolete, we're back to wampum. (standing) I'm going to the bathroom.
How the hell am I gonna pay for this?
They give you some portion here, huh?
Uh, yeah. (broaching a subject) Hey uncle Leo, I hope I wasn't uh, rude to you that day I bumped into you on the street. Uh, I really did have to get to a meeting.
(preening himself in the mirror) Aw, no, no, I understand. I got plenty of friends in showbusiness. I know you're all very busy.
So you found that watch in the garbage can, huh?
Yeah. In fact it was right after I ran into you.
Oh, heh. You know, a friend of mine has a watch just like that. I'd love to replace it for him as a gift.
Well, I haven't seen too many like (indicating watch) these.
Yeah, I know. Maybe uh, you wanna sell me that one.
(sarcastic) Aww, sure. (laughter)
(pulling Leo back in) Hang on a second. I got a little proposition for you.
(into phone) There's a George Bonanza to see you.
Costanza. Costanza.
(into phone) George Costanza.
The guy who pitched him the show with the stories about nothing. (snaps fingers) Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry Seinfeld's friend.
(into phone) Seinfeld friend. (he listens) (to George) He says, call him Monday.
(into phone, frantic) Mister Dalrimple! Mister Dalrimple I have to talk to you!
Excuse me.
It's about the show. It... No, it was...
Excuse me.
...It was all a terrible misunderstanding, sir. Just five minutes. Just five minutes of your time. (listens) Thank you! Thank you, Mister Dalrimple.
(into phone) Very good, sir.
You don't understand. I can't allow my son to pay for me. Look, as soon as I get back to Florida, I promise you I'll mail you a check.
Why don't you just let him pay, and then you can pay him back?
No, no, he won't let me do that.
Why don't you just put the money in his pants pocket, unsuspectingly?
He could wash them.
Monsieur, we are running a reputable business.
Don't tell me about business! I sold raincoats for thirty-five years!
Aha, but you did not give them away, did you?
You don't understand my...
Ah, monsieur, I cannot get involved with you and your family, ah.
Now look, don't take too long.
(looking around) Look at this building. What is this?
I don't know. It's a building.
(indicating) The door's on a diagonal.
So what?
(looking around) It's architecturally incorrect.
(frustrated) Just go.
(sidling in) Is this a bad time? I hope I'm not disturbing anything.
We were about to sit down to dinner.
(indicating) This is Cynthia.
(entering the apartment more fully) Oh. Oh, hi, hi. Hi. Nice to meet you. (peering at the table) What're you having, veal?
No.
Looks like veal.
It's not veal.
Well, it's a good looking piece of meat. (laughs nervously) Wow, this is some place. A duplex, huh? (indicating) Look at this, you got stairs in an apartment. All my life, I dreamed about having steps in an apartment. Even one step. Sunken living room. Although, one step is really not all that sunken. (tries hard to elicit a laugh)
Who gave you my address?
No, that's a fair question. It is, uhm... (nervous chuckle) Jerry, yeah. (to Cynthia) Jerry's a friend of mine. (to Russell) He uh, he gave it to me. Unbelievable how many addresses of people this guy has.
He's got Marlon Brando's. I could go to Marlon Brando's house if I really wanted.
Course, I wouldn't, I mean uh, the guy is uh, well obviously (to Cynthia, as she passes) the guy has his problems.
So, what's the surprise? You wanna talk about the show?
Well, you know, it's really very funny, because you know what we got here, really? We really, really, just have a terrible misunderstanding. You see, when I passed on the deal, I thought that's what Jerry wanted me to say. Y'know, I, I misinterpreted.
(bored) Russell, where's the TV Guide.
Oh, what time is it? Eight thirty? I'll tell you what's on. You got Major Dad, Blossom, very funny programme...
Blossom's on Monday.
Are you sure? Oh, look who I'm talking to. The president of NBC. (forced laughter)
Look Mister Costanza, it's too late now anyway. I already made a deal with another writing team.
(worried) Alright, alright. Look, we're people, you and me, huh? Businessmen. Colleagues, if I may. Let's not quibble. We'll do it for the thirteen thousand. Thirteen thousand, and I never came up here, we never talked, alright. You take good care. (moving past Russell toward the door) It was nice seeing you again, and nice meeting you. (to Cynthia) Cynthia, right?
Alright, now look. These deals are already made.
Awright, lemme just say this. Ten thousand dollars, alright, and now I'm going below what you wanted to pay. You have your dinner, have your veal, or whatever it is. Enjoy...
Mister Costanza.
Alright, that's it. Alright, good, eight thousand dollars. (to Cynthia) Cynthia, again, nice meeting you. Have I commented on the shoes? I love suede, it's so thick and rich. Did you ever, you ever rub it against the grain? Alright, anyway...
(bored, frustrated) Russell, can we eat?
(to George) Alright. Eight thousand.
(pleased) You've made Jerry very happy.
May I just use your bathroom for a moment?
Alright, two hundred, but that's as high as I can go. I really think you're being unreasonable here!
Jerry, I'd give you the watch. It's not the money, I happen to like it.
Look, I happen to know how much that watch cost. It's a sixty dollar watch, you paid forty to get it fixed. That's a hundred dollars. I'm offering you two hundred!
(indicating) I've never seen a band like this.
Aww, right. Three hundred, plus fifty for the repair. Three fifty, that's it!
You have it on you?
Yeah, I think I do.
(under his breath) This is unbelievable.
What the hell is going on here?
Well, it uh, (offering his hand) it's a pleasure to meet you.
(shaking hands) Thank you for coming in.
Thank you.
Please, sit down.
(quiet) Okay.
Could I offer you something to drink. Uhm, coffee? Anything?
Okay uh, yeah. I'll have a uh, you have a decaf cappuccino?
I don't think we have that.
Well, that's a little strange.
Uh, why does that surprise you?
Well, it's uh, it's a very popular drink
This is an office.
That's true. But, you know, I can't help but think that uh...
(interrupting) So tell me Mister Kramer...
...Okay, yes, shoot.
Tell me all about uh, you and Elaine.
Oh, alrighty uh...
Well, what we have here, doctor, is uhm, an extraordinary situation.
Is it?
Oh, you better believe it.
(singing) '...Travelling along...'
'...singing a song, side by side...'
Wow. You really have a terrible voice.
Do I know you?
Uhh, I don't think so.
'Cos you really look familiar.
Oh, well maybe you've seen me. My face is on uhm, Mount
Oh yes, of course, that's it. I guess I'm just used to seeing it on a much larger scale.
Oh yeah, right. I replaced uh, Teddy Roosevelt.
Oh really.
Umm. Trustbuster. Bust this.
You know, I never thought of it like that before, doctor. (points) You, are absolutely right.
I'm glad we agree.
(reaching in pocket) Hey, would you like a cigar? Y'know, they're Cubans.
I'd love one.
Yeah. You know, I think Elaine is a wonderful woman. You two are gonna make a wonderful couple.
If you ever feel, a need to talk to someone...
(lighting Dr Reston's cigar) Uh huh.
...About anything. You have my number.
(lighting his own cigar) Well, that's very kind of you.
Mmm, these are good, huh?
(quiet) Oh.
I cannot believe I'm doing this. I never meet people like this. You're not a nut, are you?
No, I don't think so.
I can't believe I'm doing this. I never do stuff like this.
(joking) Really? I give out my number to just about every customer who comes in here.
Oh. (chuckles) Really? You don't seem that desperate.
(playing it straight) Oh yeah. Actually, I'm a little disappointed. I kind of had my eye on uncle Leo.
Uh huh. Well uh, I'll give you a call, and thanks for the fish. By the way, you know why fish are so thin?
Why?
They eat fish.
Hey.
What happened? What took you so long?
Hey, he's a terrific guy.
Wha...? What are you talking about? What'd he say?
Well, we talked about a lot of things.
You talked about a lot of things? Well...
Yeah.
Did you talk about us?
I'm in love. I just met her outside in the street. Her
Did you say Elaine?
How come the psychiatrist, every, the hour is only fifty minutes? Wha, what do they do with that ten minutes that they have left? Do they just sit there going, "Boy, that guy was crazy. I couldn't believe the things he was saying. What a nut! Who's coming in next? Oh, no, another headcase!"
You shoulda told me it didn't work.
I know, I know.
You didn't have to throw it out.
I was always late. It was frustrating me. I'm sorry, I really am.
Oh, that must be Leo.
I woulda taken you to the airport.
He has nothing to do.
Neither do I. (to intercom) Yeah?
It's George.
Come on up. (to parents) It's George.
Oh, it's George.
What ever happened with NBC and the deal?
Ah, George turned it down.
He turned it down?
Yeah.
Why did he do that?
Because of Ted Danson.
What does Ted Danson have to do with it?
Maybe he doesn't like Ted Danson.
(fetching a drink from the fridge) Hey, who knows, maybe we'll wind up getting more money.
(to Jerry) Hey.
Hey, Georgie-boy, how are ya?
Hey, Mr Seinfeld. (shakes Morty's hand) Hey, Mrs Seinfeld. How are you?
What's the matter with you?
What'd I do?
What about NBC? Did you hear anything?
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.
We got a deal.
(simultaneous) Hey!/That's wonderful!/We got a deal!
Heyy! Terrific.
You see, he had the right idea. Hold out. That's how you get the big money, huh George? (slaps George on the shoulder)
Uh, please, Morty.
No, no, no. He knows how to talk to these people. No-one's gonna take advantage of Georgie. (slaps George's shoulder again)
I'm just happy to be working with your talented son...
Aww...
...Who's not doing this for the money.
...C'mon.
You have no idea how refreshing that is.
So what'd we get?
(big smile) Eight thousand dollars.
Beautiful!
(quietly) That's uh, for the two of us.
Four thousand apiece?
Lemme see if I understand this. In other words, you held out
I was wrong, you were right.
You know, the basic idea of negotiation, as I understand it, is to get your price to go... up.
You're smart, I'm dumb.
You know, this is how they negotiate in the bizarro world.
That's gotta be Leo.
(to intercom) Yeah?
Leo.
Alright, we're coming down.
Alright, let's get going.
Dad, before we go, I got a little something for you.
A present.
A present?
Hey! Look at this, a wallet. Exactly what I needed, y'see.
C'mon, you lost your wallet, I figured I'd get you another one.
I hope you didn't spend too much on that.
I wanna tell you. This is one of the most thoughtful gifts anyone's ever given me.
He's something, you son, isn't he?
Ah hah, alright, let's go.
You're a terrific kid.
Okay.
Yeah, he's something, isn't he?
How could anybody not like you?
(to Jerry) You're very special.
(pointedly) Yeah, I'm good for about four thousand dollars.
Hey, let's go! It's twelve (checks watch) uh, twelve twenty-two.
Alright, Leo.
Hey, uncle Leo.
Hi, hi...
How you doing?
This is some beautiful parking spot you got here.
Yeah, I hate to give it up.
Yeah. Hey, dad, you sure you don't need any more money?
Jerry!
Alright, I'm just joking. Listen, have a nice trip.
(hugging Jerry) Bye bye, Jerry.
Bye Mrs Seinfeld, take care.
Bye bye. (hugging Jerry) Thanks again for the wallet.
(shaking hands with Morty) Morty, always a pleasure.
Take care now. So long.
Yeah, like he was really gonna take your money.
Oh, he took it. I put four hundred dollars in the new wallet.
You're kidding.
He lost all that cash. It was the only way I could give it back to him, otherwise he wouldn't accept it.
Man, would I like to see the look on his face.
You believe this?
What?
(indicates the new wallet) It's velcro.
You're kidding.
Who needs this?
Leo, let's go.
...main difference between the women's wallet and the man's wallet, is the photo section. True? Women carry with them a photograph of every person they've ever met, every day in their whole lives, since the beginning of time. And every picture is out of date. You know what I mean? It's, "Here's my cousin, three years old. She's in the marines now." "This is my dog. He died during the Johnson administration." You know. You get stopped by a cop, no licence, no registration, (waves imaginary wallet) "Here's fifty-six people that know me." Cop goes. "Alright, ma'am, just wanted to make sure you had some friends, move it along. Routine pal check."
Have you ever called someone up, and you're disappointed when they answer the phone? You wanted the machine. You know, and you're always kind of thrown off, (left hand up to side of face, pretending its a receiver) you go "Oh, I eh, I - I didn't know you were there, I ah - just wanted to leave a message saying, sorry I missed you."
Well this is it.
Oh, this is nice. Thanks again for the Chinese food.
Oh, you're welcome. You know I think I ate too much of that garlic.
Yeah, me too.
No, I ate the whole plate. I didn't know those little things were garlic. I thought they were peanuts.
(laughs) - Nnnhhahahahahahahahahahahahahaha (obnoxious laugh). Oh, you know what? I think Naked Gun is on. Oh I've seen it. I laughed through that whole thing. You wanna watch?
No, I mean, I don't think so.
I thought you liked to laugh. I thought you were happy go lucky.
No, no, no. I'm not happy, I'm not lucky, and I don't go. If anything I'm sad stop unlucky.
Ahahahahahahahahaha.
That's not funny Naomi.
Ah hahahaha. (points at Jerry)
I didn't mean to be funny there. Why don't you check the TV guide. I think uh, Holocaust is on.
(on the answering machine) Jerry, it's George. Hey, hey are you all set for the weekend. This is going to be great. You're going to have a great time with Naomi.
(con't) All right, you know she's got that laugh. What did you say? It's like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer?
(con't) A-Anyway, I was thinking we would take two cars up to the cabin and that way if one of wanted to stay you know...
This thing has never worked right. (holding the machine in his hand)
You think I, laugh like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer?
Well, first of all Elmer Fudd is one of the most beloved internationally known cartoon characters of all time. "I'm going to kill that cwazy wabbit ... hahahahahaaa " Come on. Not only that, a juicer is one of the healthiest ways ... (Naomi exits) it makes the juice ... it extracts the-the pulp and-and-and the vitamins, for-for long life and-and-and vitality.
How could you leave a message like that on my machine.?
Well how could you just play your message in front of anybody?
Because I didn't think anyone would leave it!
Well, I didn't think anyone would play it.
Well, now she's not going away for this weekend.
What do you mean not goin'? Come on, we got plans here. Call her up.
Nah, it's better anyway. I mean really. What was going to happen? I'm a comedian. How can I go out with a girl with a laugh like that? I mean izz-it's like ah, it's like Coco Chanel goin' out with a fish monger. You know, cause she's with all the perfumes and a fish monger's pretty bad smell.
Wh-Well maybe you should ask Elaine.
Yeah but if I ask Elaine, then Kramer will feel slighted.
Oh no no no no, don't say anything to Kramer. Susan can't stand him. He vomited all over her.
Yeah, .. wait a minute do you smell smoke?
Hmm.
Ah, Kramer.
Hello boys, (in an Irish accent) top of the morning to ya. What do you say?
Will you put that thing out before you start another fire. You had to give him a box of cigars.
So, what are you guys doin' this weekend?
uh uh, we're uh ..
Because I'm going to be playing golf at the Westchester country club. Mmh.
Westchester? Isn't that a private club?
Oh, that's right buddy. It's private. It's very private. But I met the pro at the golf shop up on 49th St. -- I gave him one of these Cubans and he invites me up to play a free round ... then he says anytime I lay one of these babies on him it's going to be the same deal. Ha ha. Idn't that beautiful.
and GEORGE Ye, hu, um Ye,
Man, I'm going to be hitting the links all weekend. Ffoooo (Taking an imaginary swing, he makes the sound of a golf ball being hit)
Gee, that's-that's too bad.
Yeah, too bad.
Why? What wa?
Well, cause we were just saying we were going to ask you to come up to the country with us this weekend. Susan's father has a cabin up there. But, eh, all right, well.
Well, what, they got any golf courses up there?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no that's ah, that's pie country.
Yeah
Yeah, they eh, they do a lot of baking up there.
Uh huh.
They sell them by the side of the road. Blueberry, Blackberry ....
Blackberry, Boysenberry ...
Boysenberry, Huckleberry ...
Huckleberry, Raspberry...
Raspberry, Strawberry ...
Strawberry, Cranberry ...
Peach.
I don't know.
Come on. I don't want to tag along with George and Susan. If you're there it'll be a better group.
What's that?
Ah, it's an autographed picture for my dry cleaner. I never know what to write on these things. I hate doin' this.
"I'm very imPRESSED"? ... Ah you mean pressed caus' its like a dry cleaner?
Yeah, see that's why I hate it. So, come on, you going to go?
Well what about the sleeping arrangements? In the Cabin!
Well, um same bed ...
uh huh (very quietly)
.. and uh, underwear and a tee shirt.
What about me?
Well you'd be naked of course.
Uh, that's, ...
Excuse me, Jerry Seinfeld?
Yeah.
My name's Sanger, Mel Sanger.
Hi.
I drive that truck out there.
Oh, the Yoo Hoo?
Yeah.
I love Yoo Hoo.
Yes, it's a fine product. Anyway I saw you on the Tonight Show a couple weeks ago. I was watching the show with my son Donald. He's got this rare immune deficiency in his blood ... the damnedest thing. Doctors say he has to live in a plastic bubble. Can you imagine that? A bubble.
A bubble?
A bubble?
Yes, a bubble!
Do you mind? May I?
Oh, sure.
Ah, It'd break your heart seein' him in there. It's like a prisoner. No friends - just his mother and me. And I'm out there six days a week haulin' Yoo Hoo. We have sacrificed everything. All for the sake of our little ... bubble boy.
(in tears) Excuse me, I ah ...
Oh right here (giving out paper napkins to Mel and Jerry and herself)
Excuse me, anyway we were watching ya on TV.
You get in the bubble with him?
No. He can see through the bubble. It's plastic.
Oh, I thought it was like an igloo.
No, it's clear.
Ah ha.
Who has the remote? (wipes a tear from her eye)
He does.
The remote goes through the bubble?
Yeah, he's in the bubble with the remote.
So you have no control over the remote?
No, it's frustrating.
Mmm
Yeah, of course, yeah. (blows her nose)
So anyway, you're his favorite comedian. He laughed so hard the other night we had to give him an extra shot of hemoglobin.
Awe... That's nice!
Tomorrow is his birthday and it would mean so much to him if you could find it in your heart ta' pay him a visit and, just say hello.
Hu, well, tomorrow, I, ...
Jerry! Of course he'd pay him a visit. You'd be happy to.
Yeah, uh, Ok, uh, tomorrow uh, where da ya - where do you live, uh, up town? Upper west side?
No, up state.
Up state! Hummm.
He's a bubble boy.
A bubble boy?
Yes. A bubble boy.
What's a bubble boy?
He lives in a bubble.
Boy!
Say, so what kind of a bubble? Like an igloo?
No, that's what I thought but apparently it's just a big piece of plastic dividing the room.
Oh.
What kind of plastic do you think it is? What do you think like that dry cleaning plastic?
That's no good. He wouldn't last ten minutes in there. Anyway what can I do, I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow. It's his birthday. I can't go to the cabin.
Well, where does he live?
I don't know, up state, Falls, somethin'
Wait a minute, This is right on the way to the cabin.
Well all right, beautiful, so you stop in. Ya, ya visit the bubble boy for twenty minutes and then we can go.
You think we can do it?
Oh I know exactly where this is. You can just follow us.
Oh, great. Ok we'll goin' away. I think I'm excited.
(laughs) hu hu.
I'm excited. Oh, you're going to love this cabin. My grandfather built it in 1947. It's it's incredible.
Ohh.
All right there you go. It's a '47 cabin all right. So, we'll see you tomorrow.
OK.
Well,
and JERRY Very nice, very nice, nice.
Well, I'm off to the links.
and JERRY Yeah.
Listen, I want to thank you for the invite up state. I'm sorry I can't make it.
(clears his throat)
The what?
Uh, nothing, lets get going. Come on. (laughs) hu hu.
Did you ... (George grabs her hand)
No, no, no we'll talk about it later.
Is that one of the cigars my father gave you? (Susan is pulled from the apt. and Kramer looks out the door to watch them leave)
Hey, what's with George and Susan? Does he actually like her?
Ah, I don't know if he likes her as much as he likes it.?
Oh, that's nice!
What's he doing? What is his hurry?
Well you know George. It's not good enough to get there. You gotta make good time.
I know he once went from West 81st Street to Kennedy Airport in 25 minutes.
Hmhmhm (laughing quietly)
Look at him.
Hmhmhm (laughing quietly)
Would you stop that please. Would you just stop that?
Why?
Knock it off, just sit in your seat over there you're distracting me. We're making incredible time here. I once went into Kennedy Airport from West 81st Street to in uh, in 15 minutes. hu uh. Oh, here hold this. It's uh, ten dollars for the tolls.
What's he doing? Is he out of his mind? Do you see him? I don't even think I see him anymore. Where is he?
Isn't that blue car him?
No, no that's not him. What happened to him? I can't believe it. I lost him. That stupid idiot. Now what are we going to do?
It's no big deal Jerry. We'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.
I don't even know where the bubble boy lives. I - I don't even remember the name of the town.
Wa',you don't have the directions?
No, I was following him.
How could you not take the directions?
Because, HE'S my directions.
I didn't see them George.
We make all these plans - this idiot goes a hundred miles an hour - the whole weekend's over - incredible - just like that -
Poor little bubble boy. He's sitting there waiting for you in his bubble, or igloo thing, whatever.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM.
Here just get off at this exit. We'll figure somethin' out.
We lost them. Do you KNOW THAT. WE LOST THEM!
Well it's not my fault. Seinfeld can't drive. How hard is it to follow somebody?
Well now what are you gonna do?
It's fine, we'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.
Does he have the address?
(answering machine) Leave a message. I'll call you back. Thanks.
(on phone speaker) Hi, Jerry it's Naomi. Ah, listen, if its not too late I, changed my mind, I'd like to go to the cabin.
Wait, wai, ... ... Yeah. Hello!, Hi, Aw, this is Kramer. Yeah, I'm the next door neighbor. Aw, well you know, ah Jerry's left, uh, uh, But listen, ah, see ah, my golf game got canceled. Uh, I'm thinkin' of going up myself... They got pies and ah, I got the directions right here.
So then I drive all the way up to the country club and then I find out they got a tournament goin' on. Do you mind if I smoke?
No.
These are Cubans. (IN FAKE SPANISH) Maria, poquendo los scientos de estes con gleam.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ... Ha haaaa
I don't know of this is the house. I don't see Jerry's car anywhere.
Would you stop it. (Susan playfully bites his ear lobe again) Would you quit it please. Someone is going to see us here.
So what? You are SUCH a prude.
Hey, I am not a prude sweetheart. I swing with the best of them. (snapping his fingers 5 times)
Okay, Come on lets go in.
What?
Well we should at least tell them what happened. They might be very late if they make it at all.
I can't go in there. I can't face the bubble boy.
What's the matter?
I-I just don't react well to these situations. My grandmother died two months early because of the way I reacted in the hospital. She was getting' better. And then I went to pay her a visit. She saw my face. BOOM. That was the end of it.
Okay, we're goin' in. Come on.
Susan, wait please... (grabs her) Please ...
Come on George. George stop. George.
Susan, Susan would you wai,....
(ranting) I can't believe how a little thing like George going too fast - and my whole weekend is gone - the plans, the packing, ... everything.
Your whole weekend? What about the bubble boy?
Why do you keep bringing up the bubble boy. You don't have to mention the bubble boy? I know about the bubble boy. I'm aware of the bubble boy. Why do you keep reminding me about the bubble boy?
I'll have a cup of coffee and a turkey club.
How ?bout you?
Um, I'll just have a glass of water.
(whispers) You can't just have water.
Why not? That's all I want.
Well this is not like a park bench where you just come in and sit down. It's a business.
Hold it a second. Don't ?chu play on TV?
Oh, no.
YES! yes. You saw him on TV.
What's your name?
Jerry Seinfeld.
Elaaaiinne...
Garry Seinfield! I saw you on the Tonight Show.
Right. Hey, wouldn't you like an autographed picture?
Oh, ha ha
Uh, I don't have anymore pictures Elaine.
He's lying. They're in the trunk (takes car keys) Now you get to sign another one.
I'm not lying.
Yeah, yeah he is. (as she leaves)
She'll have a cup of coffee and a broiled chicken.
See it's not really a bubble. A lot of people think it's an igloo. But it's really just a plastic divider.
Huh (quietly)
and SUSAN (nod)
Can you uh, go in the bubble?
Well, you have to put so many things on because of the germs.
The gloves, the mask, it's a whole production.
So then he makes his own bed?
Well, that's one of the things we fight about.
Would you like to meet him?
Uh, well, you know,...
Oh, he loves games. Maybe you could play Trivial Pursuit with him.
HEY MA WHAT THE HELL DO I GOT TO DO TO GET SOME FOOD AROUND HERE? I'M STARVIN'. AND IF IT'S PEANUT BUTTER, I'M GONNA SHOVE IT IN YOUR FACE.
(embarrassed) Ha...ha ha ha ha, ha.
(laughing) hehehe -- One picture left in the trunk.
Uh, THANKS! This is FUN! Yeah, this turned out to be a GREAT weekend.
Where's my water?
Oh, it's comin'. - Here ya' go.
Thanks.
Waddya' write?
"Nothing's finer than being in your diner."
Hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu "Ther - There is nothing finer than being in your diner."?
No good?
THIS is what you came up with?
Well.
That is so lame. Jerry, people are going to be reading that for the next twenty years and laughing at you.
Yeah, yeah, you're right. Excuse me, excuse me. Would you mind. I'd like to take the picture back.
Why
I, I'm not happy with what I wrote.
It's good. I like it.
No, believe me it's not good. I'll mail you a new one with something really funny written on it.
Well, when you mail me a new one I'll send you back this one.
No, look, you don't understand. I, I want the picture.
RIGHT! (leaves)
This is Donald.
Hi. (waves to Donald and laughs) hahahaha.
Hello.
WHO ARE YOU? Where's Seinfeld?
He's on his way. These are his friends.
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKIN' AT? NEVER SEEN A KID IN A BUBBLE BEFORE?
Tsst...'Course I have. Come on. My cousin's in a bubble. My friend Jeffrey's uh, sister, also ... bubble ... you know. I got a lot of bubble experience. Come on.
WHAT'S YOUR STORY?
I-I-I have no story.
She works for NBC.
HOW 'BOUT TAKING YOUR TOP OFF?
Donald, behave yourself.
COME ON.
I know. I know. Why don't you play a game of Trivial Pursuit?
Ah, well, you know we gotta been running because of the ...
Ooo. WHAT? ARE YOU AFRAID?
A-hu no, uh, it's just that ...
WELL I'M GOING TO KICK YOUR ASS.
Look, I was nice enough to give you the picture. I don't like what I wrote. I don't want it up there. Now please just give it back to me.
You are really startin' to get under my skin.
I want that picture.
Well, you can't have it! In fact maybe you better just pay your check and get out.
I'm not paying for anything until I get that back.
Well, you ain't getting' it back.
Well, maybe I'll just take it back.
This chicken is really good.
OK, HISTORY ... THIS IS FOR THE GAME. ... HOW YA DOIN' OVER THERE? ... NOT TOO GOOD!
All right Bubble Boy. Let's just play... Who invaded Spain in the 8th century?
THAT'S A JOKE. THE MOORS.
Oh, Noooo, I'm so sorry. It's the MOOPS. The correct answer is, The MOOPS.
MOOPS? LET ME SEE THAT. THAT'S NOT MOOPS YOU JERK, IT'S MOORS. IT'S A MISPRINT.
I'm sorry the card says MOOPS.
IT DOESN'T MATTER. IT'S MOORS. THERE'S NO, MOOPS.
It's MOOPS.
MOORS.
MOOPS,
MOORS!
Hey! Anybody home? Oh boy.
What should we do?
Ah, hold these (boxes of) pies.
Okay.
Help, someone. (BUBBLE BOY is strangling George)
THERE'S NO MOOPS. YOU IDIOT.
Stop it. Let go of him!
Donald, stop it! Now, let go of him Donald. Donald!
I'M GOING TO KILL HIM.
You're choking me.
Donald, ... Donald...
MOORS. SAY MOORS!
MOOPS, MOOPS
Donald, No. ... Donald, stop it ..
What are you doing? You're choking me. Elaine!
Are you going to pay for that?
No, I want the picture back.
Something's happened to the Bubble Boy. They're rushing him to the hospital.
What? (releases Jerry)
The Bubble Boy? He lives around here?
That's his house right down the road.
He got in a fight with some guy.
What kind of person would hurt the Bubble Boy?
Some little bald guy from the city.
Come on -- Vern, Page, Preston, don't you think we ought to do somethin'?
Naomi, come on let's get goin'.
But that lake must be freezing.
Nah, it's good for ya'. Retards the aging process.
Ready to go swimming?
Let's go.... OK. (he snaps the towel at Naomi's backside) GOTCHA.
AHAaaaaaha
HeYAWaaa
JERRY! What happened to you?
What happened to you? You were going like a hundred miles an hour.
Oh I was not. The BUBBLE BOY was tried to kill me.
What?
Yeah, Susan tell him.
It's a long story.
Yeah.
HEY SEINFELD!
Hey, Happy Birthday.

Arghhh, look it's a fire! (cough)
Holy cow! look at that!
IT'S MY FATHER'S CABIN!
The CABIN is on fire!
(Apprehensively) Um. I just realized. Ya' never gave me back the change from the tolls.
How could this have happened?
(singing) ... It's a big, wild, funky mountain man ...
Oh, my god, the cabin?
What are you two doin' here?
Look at that.
You didn't ... (makes motion like he's lighting a cigar)
My Cubans! (runs off to the burning cabin)

Jerry's apartment]
She hasn't told her father yet?
No. We're supposed to tell him tonight.
"We're"? What do you mean, "We're"?
Susan wants me to be there.
You're meetin' the father for the first time?
(Reluctantly) Yeah.
(Chuckles slightly) Well, you'll make quite an impression on him when you tell him how you burned his cabin down.
I didn't burn it down - Kramer did!
(Laughs) I mean, the whole thing is ironic. Think of it Here the guy is nice enough to give you a box of very fine Cuban cigars..
Yeah, I know what happened.
No, but wait, wait And then you dump them off onto Kramer..
(Getting frustrated) I know.
(Continuing) ..Who, who proceeds to burn the man's cabin down with one of those very same cigars! (Topping off his observation) It's very comical..
Listen, maybe we shouldn't start writing today. I got a lot on my mind.
(Persisting) No, no, we put this off long enough. Today's the day.
(Letting his conscious get the best of him) I wonder how Susan's father's going to react to this. Alright, what- what's the worst he could do? So you burn a cabin down..
(Agreeing) C'mon. It's not even a house - it's, like, a cabin.
We could build a cabin like (Snaps) that.
(Blunt) Well, maybe not us, but two men could.
(Looking over the writing materials they just bought) Bics? What, d'ja get, bics?
What, you got a problem with the pen now?
Well, I like a rolling writer. They're very smooth.
Alright, let's just get to work. (They both move into the living room - ready to start writing their script. Jerry sits down) NBC Pilot, Seinfeld project. Act I, Scene A.
(Still standing) So, you're gonna sit there?
(Wanting to get started) Just - just park yourself. (George reluctantly sits on the sofa) Alright. Act I, Scene A.
(Offering) Drink?
No, no thank you.
(Uncapping his pen) Alright, here we go.
Act I, Scene A..
Weren't you supposed to call Elaine?
(Eagerly reaching for the phone) Yes. (George turns the TV on, and begins watching as Jerry dials the number) Hi, is Elaine there? Oh, uh, Hi, Sandra. Uh, yeah. I can hold. (To George) Every time I call I gotta chit-chat with her assistant for, like, twenty minutes. (Back into the phone) Oh, hi, Sandra. Listen, I'm at a pay phone, and there's lots of people here waiting to use it. (Yelling out for believability) I'll be off in a minute! (To Sandra) Yeah, could you just put me through to Elaine? Okay, thanks! (He turns to George) Are you thinking of ideas? (George, picking his teeth with his finger, is absorbed into the television. He seems to not even notice Jerry) Listen, Elaine, is there any way I could get through to you directly? Every time I call Sandra bends my ear for, like, twenty minutes. (Pause) So we're on for later?
Yeah, I'll come by after work. Hey, I got a rubber pencil thing happenin' here.. (Sandra passes her doorway) Uh, I gotta go. I gotta go. (Hangs up) Sandra! Sandra? Hi, can you come here for a second?
Okay, let's go. (George shuts the television off, ready to work)
Alright, here we go. You got it?
Yeah.
Here we go.
Okay, how about this I'm in my apartment, you come in.
(Holding out his arms - giving praise) It's beautiful. Now, what do I say?
Could you do me a favor? Um, when my friends call, could you not talk to them for too long?
Why? Did Jerry say something?
No, no.
He must have said something.
Oh, no, he didn't say anything.
(Near tears) I can't work for you! I can't. I'm leaving. (Exits quickly)
(Calling out to Sandra) No, Sandra. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I really am! Listen, listen, Jerry's under a lot of pressure right now. It's very hard being a stand-up comedian! Sometimes they don't laugh!
Alright, let's go.
Here we go.
Hey.
yeah, Kramer, we're, uh, kind of in the middle of something here. We're trying to do a little work..
Yeah, come on. (Kramer gives out a frustrated sigh) What's with you?
(Complaining) No more golf.
Why?
Well, you remember I told you about the pro, you know, at the Westchester Country Club, who's letting me play a round every time I give him a couple of those Cuban cigars?
Yeah.
(Angered) Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire! (Leaning over the couch, he addresses George) Hey, George, maybe you can ask Susan's father for more, huh?
What are you, Crazy? I can't ask the guy for more cigars after you burned down his cabin!
Why? What's one thing got to do with another?
Kramer, please.
Well, I can't go back to the public courses, now. I can't! I won't. I mean, you know what that's like? It's crowded, the grass has big brown patches in it, they don't rake the sand traps! Not to mention the caliber of people you have to play with!
Kramer, I can't help you. You're gonna have to get them some place else.
(Opening the door) Where? They're Cubans. (Leaves)
(Getting up) You know what? Maybe I should take off.
What?!
Well, you know, I gotta go to, uh, Susan's parent's house for dinner.. and, you know, I want to shower first.. and I want to leave myself plenty of time.
(Looking at his watch) You got four hours! What about the script?
I think we got a bite on it. (Exits)
The Ross' house]
(To Mr. Ross) Doesn't George look like your sister, Sarah?
(Gruff) A slight resemblance.
(To George) Her son's a podiatrist, you know.
Ohh, I have tremendous respect for people who work with feet. I mean, to dedicate yourself to the foot - you're toiling in virtual anonymity. I mean..
How are you enjoying those cigars I gave you?
Oh, uh, the cigars.. (Chuckles nervously) I'm, uh, suckin' 'em down. I'm puffing my brains out, yeah.
You know those cigars are made special for Castro?
(Impersonating Carson) I didn't not know that. Weird. Wild. (Susan and George both laugh)
What?
(Explaining) He's doing Johnny Carson, daddy.
I didn't care much for his jokes.
(To George) Daddy never laughs.
Oh, well, so what? Laughter - what is that? I mean, what is the point of opening your mouth and going "Ha, ha!"? What is that? "Ha, ha!"?
You know, you can't get those cigars anywhere.
You and your cigars..
(Shooting back at his wife) Wear some more lipstick.
Daddy, there's, um, there's something that we have to talk to you about..
Oh, I forgot to ask you - how'd you like the cabin?
(Even more nervous than before) Oh, the, uh, the cabin.. well, (Clears throat)
Jerry's apartment]
Right after we get off the phone, then you go and tell her that?! Well, of course she knows it was me who complained! Now I'm responsible for this woman's quitting. Oh, this is unbelievable!
(Full of guilt) I know! I screwed up. It's all my fault. Would you call her?
(Caving in) Ohh.. dial the number. (Elaine picks up the phone, and starts to dial) How could you do this?
(Handing the phone over to him) I was just trying to help you.
(Muttering) Oh, just trying to (Rudely grabs the phone from her) help me.. (Into the phone) Hello? Sandra? Hi, uh, this is Jerry Seinfeld. (Elaine now has her hand in a bowl of popcorn - grabbing a fistful) Listen, I - I just want to tell you, (Jerry sternly grabs Elaine's hand - forcing her to drop the popcorn, then shoves her hand away. Elaine sits back like a scolded child) There's been a terrible misunderstanding See, I told Elaine that, uh, it was a real treat talking to you on the phone, and she thought I was being sarcastic, you know, 'cause I'm a comedian and all. She thought I meant (Deeply sarcastic) "Yeah, it was a real treat talking to her on the phone." (Back to normal) You know, but I was really being sincere.. No, of course I like you.. Tonight? ..Um, uh, hold on a second. (To Elaine, whispering) Now she wants to have a drink with me. (Elaine mouths out "Just go" while making gestures. Jerry, again, gives in. Back on the phone) Yeah, I think I can.. Um.. yeah, I know where that is.. Ok.. uh, I'll see you there. Okay, bye. (Hangs up, peeved) Now I gotta have a drink with her.
The Ross' house]
The cabin.. (Laughs nervously) Well.. (Pauses as he thinks of a way to break the news, then decides to pass it off) Susan?
Uhh.. about the cabin..
(Cutting her off) I love that place. My father built that cabin in 1947. My mother was recuperating from Impetigo at the time, and dad thought it would be a good idea to get her out into the fresh air. She died there the following winter. And he passed away 10 years later to the day. His last words to me were, (Mrs. Ross, bored out of her mind, has obviously heard this story a million times - she mouths the words as Mr. Ross says them) "Cherish the cabin." Not, uh, "Take care of your sister." (Adding) She's a paraplegic. But, "Cherish the cabin." (Smiling, reflecting) And I have.. for 45 years. It's often been a.. sanctuary for me.
(Annoyingly butting in) Kinda like Superman's fortress of solitude.
What?
S, uh, Superman - he, uh, built the fortress of solitude up at the North Pole, to, uh, you know, sort of get away from it all..
When I go, I'm passing it on to her. (Pointing at Susan)
(Drunk, she laughs out loud) I'll take a hotel any day.
Daddy..
Yes?
Daddy, about the cabin..
(Laughing, she points to her shirt) Look, Henry, I spilled wine on me! (Laughs again)
(To Susan) What about it?
Well, the thing is..
What? What is it?
Well, the - the cabin, is, kind of, uh.. George?
(Extremely blunt) Burned.
Burned?
There was a fire, and it uh..
Burned.
(Still trying to comprehend what has happened) The cabin burned?
(Laughs) yeah, burned. Whoo..
(Laughing out loud) Burned! (George laughs with her)
Was anything found? Was it all burned to the ground?! Did they find anything?
(Solemn) No. Nothing.
(Laughing, she's obviously getting a kick out of her husband's misfortune) Nothing! Ha, ha, ha.
Eh, but, you know, Mr. Ross, if - if you look at the whole situating, what with it being your cigars, and everything, it's really rather ironic - one might even say, in a sense, comical.. (Mr. Ross has, by now, left the room. Mrs. Ross is pointing at George, nodding, laughing. As if to say he hit the bullseye. George calls out to Mr. Ross) Really. Think about it.
Jerry's apartment]
(Offended) I can't believe you said that!
What?!
(Buttoning her jacket) How could you say something like that to me?!
What? What?! You were the one who was talking dirty. I was just trying to keep up!
That was a weird thing to say.
Why? It didn't mean anything. I was just trying to join in so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.
Ohh, I think you're really sick.
(Getting slightly offended) I'm not sick. (Pointing at her) You - you said much sicker things than me.
I'm leaving. (Moves toward the door. Jerry blocks her path)
I really think you're making too much of this.
(Attempting to get past him) Excuse me. (They both move to the door)
Let me walk you to a cab.
(Opens the door) That's ok.
I mean, the main thing is that this is just between us, and that'll be the end of it.
Oh, really? (Quickly walks out)
(Calling after her) I mean, people - they're not interested in things like this. They don't want to hear about it. They really don't.
The Coffee shop]
So, we're.. uhh, drinkin' and talkin', and uhh, so, she starts rubbing my leg.
Wo-hoah! What did you do?
(Sarcastic) Have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg?
Yeah, right.
I mean, I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in Elaine's office. I know it's wrong - but I can't get that hand off my leg. I mean, I'm looking at the hand, and I'm thinking, "That hand should not be on my leg." But I can't make my brain to get my mouth to say the words, "Would you mind?!"
Yeah, woman have no problem getting the hand off. How do they do that?
I don't know, they're working on a whole other level..
Alright, so, go ahead.
So we go back to my apartment..
(Expressing shock) Woah. Whoa! Woah!
So, we're, uh, foolin' around there.. you know, it's getting a little passionate.. (Scoots closer to George, to prevent others from hearing) and, uh, she starts with the dirty talking.
(Putting his hands up) Alright, alright, hold on! (Jerry has George's full attention) Time out! Woah, woah! (Scooting in, giddy) What did she say?
(Modest) Oh, you know, the usual..
No, I don't know. How do I know the usual?
Typical things.
(Picking up the ketchup) What typical? Gimme typical. Gimme some typical.
She says, uh.. (Mumbles something inaudible. George, so shocked by what he's just heard, accidentally squeezes the ketchup bottle - ketchup squirts out and files off-screen. George reacts deeply)
(Breathing deeply) That's very dirty. (Jerry nods) That's absolutely filthy.
..And then she starts talking about her panties.
(Yelling out to a waitress) Gonna need some water here!
So I said something.
Ok, what did you say?
(Defensively) Now, bear in mind, I am just trying to keep up.
Of course.
Okay? So, she's taking about her panties, so, uh.. So, I said, "You mean the panties your mother laid out for you?"
(Takes a few seconds to mull this one over. Shooting Jerry a confused look, he repeats it) "The panties your mother laid out for you"? (Jerry nods) What does that mean?
(Throwing up his hands) I don't know! It just popped out.
Well, how did she react?
She flipped out! Just left.
Well, that's not offensive. (Reflects) It's abnormal, but it's not offensive.
Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about any of this. I mean, especially the panty remark. I mean, it's embarrassing. And she's never let me hear the end of it.
She will tell her. She's going back to work. I talked her into it - how stupid was that? (Changing subject as they both collect money to pay for the check) Hey, so, Susan's father took that news pretty hard, huh?
Yeah, yeah. He went into the bedroom and started sobbing.
I guess he failed to see the humor in it.
Huh. (Makes a "over his head" gesture with his arm) C'mon, let's go, go. We got a lot of work to do today.
(Getting up) Alright, big work day.
That's right.
Jerry's apartment]
Okay.
Let's go.
Here we are.
Right now.
Let's do it.
You and me.
Okay.
Alright.
What'dya got?
(Reading from his notebook) I got You enter, you go "Hi", and I go, "Hello." Now.. we need something here..
Oh, hey.
Don't be silly.
Come in, we're taking a break.
(Moving back into the room) Oh, yeah?
Yeah!
Uh, George, did you talk to that guy about getting me some more cigars?
(Scoffs) No, I told you, I'm not gonna do that.
(Concluding) Okay.. well, I guess I'm just going to have to take matters into my own hands, huh? (Pause) Alright, I'll see you guys. (Leaves, despite "No, don't go!" and other various comments by Jerry and George)
United Nations' Permanent Mission of Cuba building]
Buenos dias.
Buenos dias.
Uh, habla ingles?
Si.
Giddy-up. Ok, uh, (Looks at a woman wearing dark sunglasses and sitting on a sofa behind him. He reacts oddly) Um. I need to talk to someone.
What is this about?
Uh, well, It's a very private matter, but it's extremely urgent.
Are you an American?
Oh, yeah.
I see.. excuse me. (Picks up the phone)
Okay.
Jerry's apartment]
(Stirring, he gets up to answer the buzzer) Alright, let's get going. C'mon, c'mon now. (Approaches the intercom) C'mon, let's get it together.. (Through intercom) Yeah?
It's Elaine.
C'mon up. (Slightly opens the door for Elaine)
(Standing up, still waking up) Alright, you know what we should do? We should go to the movies. Get away from this script for a while..
(Agreeing) Yeah, we should.
Alright, I just have to go over to the Ross' apartment and drop off Susan's sunglasses. You'll come with me?
Yeah. Wha - what, does she live with them?
No, no, no, no.
Oh.
Hey, nice going, Jerome Seinfeld!
What?
I just got a message from Sandra, she's coming back to work.
Well, then, you've just got to fire her! Don't even think about it - there's no two ways about it.
Why? What happened? Did you talk?
Talk? Did I talk? It - you're darn right I talk to her! We talked up a storm - and I concluded from the basis of these talks that this isn't anybody you should be talking to.
Really?
Yes.
Really? You really think I should fire her?
Oh yeah. Yeah, in fact, if George and I weren't so busy here working on the script, I'd do it myself.
United Nations' Permanent Mission of Cuba building]
(To secretary) Expira te afuera.
(Standing up, greeting the men) Buenos dias.
What is your name, Senor?
Uh, Kramer.
So, Senor Kramer, what is this about?
(Leaning in, confidentially) Cigars.
(Confused) Cigars?
(Definite) Cigars.
What about cigars?
Uh, see here, I.. (Pulls out a paper ring from his pocket) I saved one of the cigar rings..
Ohh.. (Laughs, pulling a cigar from his inner coat pocket) You mean - one of these..
(Pointing at the cigar, incredibly nervous) Yeah, yeah. That- that's, uh, okay, So, uh, I'd like to buy a couple of boxes of those from you, yeah?
(Deeply sniffs the cigar's aroma) You do realize, of course, these are illegal in your country.
Um, wha - oh, illegal, huh?
I like that jacket..
The Ross' apartment]
Hi!
Hi, how are ya? (They kiss)
Hey, Jerry.
Hi.
I thought you two guys were working today.
Ah, just - takin' a little break.
(Chuckling) yeah. Uh, oh, here's your sunglasses. (Hands them to her)
Ok, thanks. Come on in for a second. (They move into the living room. Susan gestures to a man sitting on the couch reading the paper) This is my brother, Ricky. He's home from college for the weekend.
Ohh, hey there, young fella. (They shake hands) What's your major?
(Blunt) I don't have one.
Well, you should always consider podiatry. (Patting Ricky on the shoulder) There's nothing wrong with the feet. (Ricky looks critically back at George)
(Now gestures to an old woman in a wheelchair) And this is my Aunt, Sara.
(Staring at George) He doesn't look like me.
Sara, what do you have on your wheels?
Nothing, they're clean.
Ricky, did you wipe her wheels off?
(Annoyed) Yes.
(Concluding) Well, they're filthy. It's just a matter of common courtesy.. (Wheels Sara over to a spot off the rug) When you come in the house you wipe your wheels.
Excuse me. (Answer the door. It's her doorman, Raymond, carrying a burnt box) Hello, Raymond.
Ah, yes, the man from the insurance company dropped this off this morning. He said it was the only thing left from the remains of the fire.
(Accepts the box) Oh, thank you. (As the doorman leaves, she turns to Jerry and George) Wow, I've never seen this before.. (Opens the charred box) Oh, they're letters. (Hands the box to George) Here.
Oh, sure. (Holds the box out as Susan takes out a few letters)
From.. (Trying to read one) from John Cheever.
Oh, wow.
(Chuckles as she opens up one of the letters. She reads it) "Dear Henry, last night with you was bliss. I fear my.. orgasm (She now has everyone's attention) has left me a cripple. I don't how how I shall ever get back to work.. (Jerry and George make odd faces as Susan is still concentrating on the notes) I love you madly, John. (Pause) P.S. Loved the cabin." (George nods, and Jerry gives a "Oh, of course" reaction)
Well, we.. we, we, ah..
(Looking at his watch ) Yeah..
We really should be, uh, heading out..
Yeah. (Tapping his watch) Look at the time.
You know, the time..
The box! (Rushes toward George, grabbing the box away from him, then the letters from Susan's hands) My letters! Gimme that! (Now holding them against his chest, defensively) Who told you to open this?!
(Hysterical) Who's John?! Who's John?!
(Yelling out) I knew it!
I want to know who John is!
John Cheever?! Dad, you and John Cheever?!
(Proclaiming) Yes! Yes, he was the most wonderful person I've ever known. And I love him deeply! In a way you could never understand.. (Slowly walks back to his room, leaving everyone speechless. Susan seems to be affected the most. A long pause passes. Jerry gives George a signal that they should go)
Well, we really should be-
Yeah.
Uh, heading out. Jerry really hates to miss the coming attractions.
Yeah, and, (Pointing to his watch) because of the.. (Slowly exiting) time.
yeah, time is what he's indicating there..
(Waving good bye) We'll see ya.
Uh, anyway, (Waving bye to everyone) onward and upward.
Jerry's apartment]
Alright, here we go.
Alright, let's go.
Come on now.
Right now.
Here we go.
You and me.
You got it.
No foolin'
Ok, so, what'dya got?
(Looking at his notebook) Alright, I got, uh, you come in, you say "Hi", and I say "Hello".
Alright, so, we need something..
Yeah.. how about this I say "How's it goin'?"
"How's it going?" - beautiful.
(Getting up to answer the door) Alright, did you get that line?
(Nodding, writing) "How's it going?"
Did you write it down?
I'm writin' it. "How's it going?"
Okay.. (Opens the door to a frantic Elaine)
Real good!
What?!
Do you know how much money you cost me today?! 429 dollars!
What?! How?
I got Sandra transferred to another office upstairs, okay?! So, she blabs to Lippman about my long distance calls to Europe!
What calls?!
Uh! I made a friend when I was in Europe, okay?! And we've been in touch, and Sandra told Lippman!
Oh, did - did she say anything else to you?
(Confused) "Anything else"? What do you mean "anything else"?
So she just left the office - didn't say a word to you about anything?
Yeah!
(Smiling to himself) Beautiful.
Why is that beautiful?
Oh, no, not beautiful.
It's four hundred and twenty nine dollars!
Hey, look, I'm going to pay for that.
No, no.
(Taking out his checkbook) No, I insist. I was the one who encouraged you to fire her - the whole thing was all my-
(Giving up too easy) Okay.
(Pauses, noting Elaine's quick accept) fault. (Starts to write a check out, then stops, looking at the door) Do you smell smoke?
Oh, hey! Hey, Jer, I want you to meet my new friends, here. (Introducing each one) This is, uh, Louis, Jorge, and Umberto.
Oh, how you doing? Nice to meet you.
Yeah, we're heading up to Westchester - gonna hit the links.
Oh. (Notices Louis' jacket) Isn't that, uh, your..
(Trying to avoid the issue) Oh, yeah, yeah, Okay, we're going. (To his three friends) Vamanos, muchachos!
(Turns to George, he is now reading a book) Hey, what are you reading?
Oh, uh, "The Falconer" by John Cheever. It's really excellent.
(To Jerry) John Cheever, you ever read any of his stuff?
Uh, yeah, I'm familiar with some of his writing. (George shoots Jerry a smirk, then returns to his book) Alright, (Hand the check to Elaine) look, we gotta get back to work. We just had a big breakthrough here.
(Folding up the check) Ok, I'll leave you two alone.
(Moving back into the living room) Okay.
(In the door way) Maybe I'll go visit my mother. She just bought me some new panties (Jerry pauses right before sitting in his chair) and they're - all laid out for me. (Leaves, smiling to herself. Jerry and George both look at each other, frozen in their places)
(answering machine) leave a message and I?ll call you back, thanks. JOE DIVOLA Jerry, Joe Divola. *Pbt* *Pbt* *Pbt* I have a hair on my tongue, I can't get it off, you know how much I hate that? Course you do, you put it there. I know what you said about me Seinfeld. I know you badmouthed me to the execs at NBC, put the kibosh on my deal. Now I?m gonna put the kibosh on you. You know I?ve kiboshed before, and I will kibosh again.
So, what do you think?
About what?
About the opera.
Nah, I don't wanna go.
You gotta go.
I-I-I don't like the opera. What are they singing for? Who sings? You got something to say, say it!
Jerry, you don't understand, that?s the way they talk in Italy, they sing to one another. Kramer starts to sing in bad Italian.
All right, all right.
That?s the way it was, you know. You listen to the language, its got that sing songy quality. It?s the language Jerry, the language
So why don't they talk like that now?
Well its, uh, well its too hard to keep up, you know, they were tired.
Better get that
Yeah?
(intercom) it?s me!
Come on up.
So, huh?
I don't know
Oh come on Jerry, its opening night, black tie, Pagliacci! The great clown, the great sad tragic clown, like you.
Well it?s very flattering. How did you get these tickets, I heard they're impossible to get.
Oh, well I have many associates.
I don't know, opera, it?s not my kind of thing.
All right, you not gonna go I?m not gonna go, I?m gonna call the whole thing off.
No, wait a minute, wait a minute, that?s not fair, what about George, Susan and Elaine, what do you need me for?
You're the nucleus, the straw that stirs the drink. You're the Miana!
Well I guess if I?m the Miana I should go. All right, all right.
Hi!
Hi!
Hey! Hi Elaine!
You got the tickets right?
Well no, I don't have them on me.
What? That?s why I came all the way over here.
My friends got 'em, I?m going to pick them up tomorrow.
Oh, I was gonna surprise Joey with them, you got an extra one right?
Oh yeah!
So I finally get to meet your pal Joey.
Its killing you isn?t it?
Yeah, so Joey?s a great lover of the opera
Listen, I got news for ya, its nice to be involved with somebody who?s interested in something other than nick at night. Now he?s got a grip on reality, he's happy, he's well adjusted.
Well I?m looking forward to meeting him.
I've got to go
Where are you going, what?s the rush?
I'm going to surprise Joey, I?ve never been to his apartment so I?m just going to 'pop in'
Oh, good, men love that!
Hey!
You've got a message buddy.
Ooo, could be from that blonde
Oo yiggity diggigg
(answering machine message)'Jerry, Joe Divola. I have a hair on my tongue'
(shouting) Kramer what am I going to do did you hear that that guy's gonna put a kibosh on me he's crazy he's out of his mind....
Steady, steady, now calm yourself, come on, now get a hold of yourself,
What the hell he's supposed to be on medication I don't understand he told me he's getting medication what happened to his medication!?
OK Quiet! Quiet! Now let me think!
I'm gonna call the cops. That?s what I?m doing, I?m calling the cops.
The cops? What are you calling the cops for? They?re not going to do anything!
What do you mean they're not going to do anything, they're the cops, they gotta do something, he just put the kibosh on me, do you know what the kibosh means, its a kibosh!
Yiddigtkk ka kibosh.
I mean it's a terrible mistake, I mean he thinks I ruined some deal of his at NBC, I don't know anything about any deal at NBC.
Call him and tell him
That?s what I?ll do, I?ll just call him and tell him, I?ll tell him. That?s all I?ll do. He's a human being, I?ll talk to him. He'll understand. Right?
Right.... Don't mention my name
Oh, I got the machine.
What?s his message like?
Nice!
Eh!
(into phone) Hello Joe, listen this is Jerry Seinfeld, I really think there?s been a huge colossal misunderstanding,
Big! Big!
and I feel if we can just talk about this we can straighten the whole thing out, so listen, so call me back. Bye.
Joey? Joey?
Oh god, oh, its you! You scared me!
Good. Fear is our most primal emotion.
You left your door open.
I know, I like to encourage intruders.
(laughs) What?s all this?
Do you like it? My home is a shrine to you.
Where did you get all these pictures?
I took them myself with a telephoto lens. Coming out of your office, your apartment, shopping, showering.
Showering?
I developed them myself in my dark room. Would you like to see?
In the dark room? Uh no, no thank you. Not right now. I'm a day person!... Are you all right?
Why
Well I don't know, you just don't seem yourself?
Who am I? Who am I supposed to be?
That?s a good question, good question, its very... exerstential! Who are you? Who am I? Yeah, well.
What are you doing here?
Oh, nothing, I just stopped by to chat, you know, shoot the breeze.
Were you able to get those opera tickets to Pagliacci from that friend of yours? I'm really looking forward to it.
Oh, no, he couldn't get them. We're not going.
Really?
Oh, dammit, you know I just remembered I gotta go, I left something on, the gas, the lights, the water in the tub. Something is on somewhere so I?m just gonna get the uh..
You know the story of Pagliacci, Nedda?
Uh.. I?m Elaine!
He's a clown whose wife is unfaithful to him.
Oh.
Do you think I?m a clown, Nedda?
Do I think you're a clown? No, not if it?s bad to be a clown, if it?s bad to be a clown then you are definitely not a clown. But if its good to be a clown then, you know, I would have to rethink the whole thing.
You've betrayed me with another, haven't you, Nedda? Who is he. I want you to tell me who he is. I want his name. Tell me his name.
Oh, like any man would ever look at me, come on, I?m gonna... get out of here.
Pagliacci kills his wife.
Se, now that?s terrible, that is not a nice thing to do at all, I don?t know how this Paliachi thing turns out but you know I would assume that there is big big trouble for that clown
You're not leaving
(on phone) But officer, he threatened me! I don't understand, that?s not right! What if it was the President of the United States I bet you'd investigate. So what?s the difference, I?m a comedian of the United States, and I?ll tell you I?m under just as much pressure. Alright, thanks anyway, ok bye.
(cautiously) Who is it?
It's George.
What, are you locking the door now?
Well, well, look at you. It?s a little skimpy there isn't it?
Do you know the last time I wore this thing? Six years ago, when I made that toast at Bobby Leighton's wedding.
Ooo, that was a bad toast.
It wasn't that bad.
I never heard anybody curse in a toast.
I was trying to loosen 'em up a little bit.
There were old people there, all the relatives. You were like a Red Fox record. I mean, at the end of the toast nobody even drank. They were just standing there, they were just frozen! That might have been one of the worst all time toasts.
Alright, still her father didn't have to throw me out like that, he could have just asked me to leave. The guy had me in a headlock! Susan's not going tonight you know.
What do you mean not going? why not?
I don't know, she said she had to pick up a friend of hers at the airport. It cost me a hundred dollars this ticket.
Why doesn't she pay for hers?
That's a very good question. You know she and I go out for dinner, she doesn't even reach for the check. That?s all I?m asking for is a reach. Is that so much to ask for?
It's nice to get a reach.
Who is it?
It's me!
What, are you locking the door now?
Because of Divola! Get in here... How come you're not dressed?
I am dressed.
You're going like this?
Yeah. Hey I want you to hear something.
I thought you said people dress up when they go to the opera!
People do, I don't.
Well what about me! If you're going like that, I?m not going like this.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, do you think I?m comfortable here. I can't change, I?ve got no clothes here! You've got to go like that, I can?t go like this alone!
Why should I be uncomfortable just because my apartment is closer to town hall than yours?
That?s not the issue, we're friends, if I?ve got to be uncomfortable, you've got to be uncomfortable too!
All right, all right, I?ll wear this. It's bad enough I?ve got to go to the opera I?ve got to sit next to ozzie nelson over here.
Would you turn that down! What is that crap!
It's Pagliacci!
Oh beautiful. Listen, we've got a little problem here, we've got two extra tickets.
Why? What happened?
Well Susan isn't going and Elaine just left me a message her friend isn't going either.
That?s fantastic! We'll scalp the tickets, we'll make maybe five hundred a ticket.
What? Really?
Yeah.
People are looking for tickets here?
What, are you kidding? Opening night Pavarotti and Pagliacci. Ha, we're gonna clean up!
Oh man! I knew I was gonna love the opera.
Oh yeah right.
OK come on, let?s go get the tickets.
All right, all right.
All right, you guys listen, I've got to wait here for Elaine, I'll meet you in front of the theatre.
Oh, wait, isn't scalping illegal?
Oh yeah!
You sprayed him in the eyes with Binaca?
Cherry Binaca, it?s new.
See, I don't get that. First they come out with the regular, then a year later they come out with the cherry. They know that we like the cherry, start with cherry! Then come out with the regular!
It's like I didn't even know him. He's like a totally different person.
Well you should hear the message from my nut. Where's George and Kramer, I want to get inside already, I don't like standing out here, I feel very vulnerable.
Hey, hey, what are you doing, that?s my quarter.
No it's not, it's mine.
I was just flipping it, it's mine.
No, I dropped it, it's mine.
All right, do you want the quarter, take the quarter, but don't try and tell me it's yours.
Well it is mine.
What, do you think I care about the money? Is that what you think? You want me to show you what I care about money? Here look, here look at this, here's a dollar here look, there, that?s how much I care about money.
You think I care about money, that?s how much I care about money, I don't care about money.
Oh yeah, well why don?t you Just get lost.
Why don't you get lost.
Because I was standing here, that?s why.
Oh Yeah?
Yeah!
I kinda like this opera crowd, I feel tough... Anybody else got a problem?
Hey clown!
hey clown!
Make us laugh, clown!
Nice face, clown!
Make me laugh, clown!
I got two, I got two huh, Paliachi, who needs two, Pagliacci, come on, the great tragic clown, come on, check it out, he laughs, he cries, he sings, Pagliacci. Hey, I got two beauties right here, check it out all right.
Hey, hey. Are you selling.
Oh yeah, I?m selling.
Where are they?
Orchestra, Row G, dead center, primo! You'll think you died and went to heaven.
What do you want for them.
All right, I?ll tell you what I?ll do. Cause you look like a nice guy, a thousand dollars for the duce.
I'll give you five hundred for the pair.
Ok, it's a deal!
Pzzzt. No.
No? Are you crazy?
Look, let me handle this.
Five hundred dollars, that?s a great deal!
You're blowing this, the guys a pigeon.
Did you see that? The guy's walking away. What is wrong with you? That was a three hundred dollar profit.
Look, I know what I?m doing here George.
This is not a Metallica concert, it?s an opera alright, a little dignity, a little class, just give me my ticket, I will stand over here and sell it.
Oh, yeah.
Thank you very much. You just stand over there, I?ll stand over here.
I know where I?m standing.
Alright.
Hey!
(shouting) Get your Paliachi!
Where are they already?
I guarantee they don't sell either one of those tickets.
Hey, look, there's Bobby Eighteen?s father-in-law, Mr Reichman. George and I were just talking about that today, I can?t believe it! That?s the guy who threw George out of the wedding.
Oh, yeah, when George made that bad toast!
Do you remember the curse toast?
Oh yeah, the curse toast.
So, can you believe that message? Now I?ve got to spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.
Me too
Crazy Joe Divola
How do you know his name?
What do you mean? Why wouldn't I know his name?
I never told you his name.
I never told you his name.
Wait a second, who are we talking about here?
Joe Divola.
Right, Joe Divola
How do you know his name?
I've been out with him three times, I should know the mans name.
Oh my god, its Joe Divola
Is he stalking you? are you kidding me?
That madman is trying to kill me.
Oh, Jerry, why didn't you tell me his name! Oh my god, he accused me of seeing someone else, he said tell me his name, he said tell me his name!!
Oh! He said that! Can you imagine what he'll do if he sees me with you! He'll think I?m the one who ruined his deal at NBC and took away his girl, he'll put a kibosh on me!
Oooohh, what about me!
Excuse me
Aaahhhhh!!
But this is Pavarotti!
Three hundred dollars, that?s a lot of money.
You know Steven Holstman (?) did a production at Tunis last yeas and from what I understand, the Moslems really took to it.
All right, I?ll tell you what, you seem like a nice guy, let?s stop jerking around. Give me.. two hundred and fifty dollars, I?ve got people waiting for me, I've got to get the hell out of here.
Scalping! I told them to put out extra security.. Excuse me.
Hey pop, would you buzz off, I've got something cooking.
Costanza!?
Mr Reichman?
You've still got a mouth like a surd give me those tickets.
Harold, no, Harold, Harold be careful of you're hair transplant!
Anything is welcome, I accept change.
I don't have anything, I gave it to that guy.
You know, you could just say no, you don't have to humiliate me. I may be dressed as a clown but I am a person.
I'm telling you, the guy took.....
And I don't need people like you looking down their noses at me. I am just a street performer out here trying to make enough to get by.
Doctor! Doctor! Is there a doctor anywhere!
What, are you showing off to your girlfriend here, is that it?
I'm not his girlfriend. We dated for a while, but things didn't really work out.
You people make me sick.
That is one angry clown!
The hardest part about being a clown, it seems to me, would be that you're constantly referred to as a clown. "Who was that clown?", "I'm not working with that clown, did you hire that clown?", "The guy's a clown!". How do you even start into being a clown, how do you know that you want to be a clown, I guess you get to a point where you're pants look so bad, it's actually easier to become a clown than having the proper alterations done. Because if you think about it, a clown, if there isn't a circus around them, is really just a very annoying person. You're in the back seat of this guys Volkswagen, "What, you're picking somebody else up? Oh man!"
(Singing) Camera, curtains, lights - This is it, we'll hit the heights - Oh what heights we'll hit - On with the show this is it!
You know, it is so sad, all your knowledge of high culture comes from bugs bunny cartoons.
Oh there's that clown again, what does he want from me. Look I?m serious, I?m not kidding, I don't have the quarter, that guy took it.
I don't want any money.
I smell cherry.
It's Binaca.
Binaca?
What did we say? Two seventy-five?
Two fifty.
Two fifty? Are you sure
Yeah, yeah, I?m sure.
All right, all right, two fifty.
George!
S-Susan
I can't believe it, I?m so glad I caught you.
What are you doing here, I though you were going to the airport.
Oh, there was some problem with the plane, they landed in Philadelphia.
So what, they don?t have another plane? She couldn't take a bus?
She's coming in tomorrow. I made it!
Yeah you made it, how about that.
Oh, I?m so excited, now we get to see the opera together.
We get to go to the opera together!
Who's that?
That?s-that?s-Harry Fong, he's a very good friend of mine and he's a big opera buff. Enjoy the show there harry!... You know what.
Come on, you gotta let us in
Not without tickets.
We have tickets, we just don't have 'em with us.
Well that?s a problem. Excuse me.
You don't understand, someone's after us, a crazy clown is trying to kill us.
A crazy clown is after you? Oh that?s rich. Now clear the entrance so people with tickets can get through.
We're with him, we're with him.
Are you guys ready?
Yeah, Yeah!!
Have you seen George?
We thought he was with you.
Come on, he's on his own, come on!
These are great seats huh?
Yeah
Yeah
Boy, some cast, huh? Pavarotti, Aver Martone.
Aver Martone. I've heard of her, who's she playing?
She's playing, Pagliacci?s wife, Nedda.
Nedda?
Yeah.
Oh my god..
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.
Susan! What are you doing here?
My Friend's flight couldn?t make it.
Where's George?
I got his ticket.
He decided not to come. He said he was uncomfortable.
Uncomfortable? How does you think I feel?.. Hey let me ask you something, how much did you pay for that ticket?
One seventy-five.
Kramer, who'd you sell your ticket to?
Some nut in a clown suit!
I had some friends drag me to an opera recently, you know how they've got those little opera glasses, you know, do you really need binoculars, I mean how big do these people have to get before you can spot 'em. These opera kids they're going two-fifty, two-eighty, three-twenty-five, they're wearing big white woolly vests, the women have like the breastplates, the bullet hats with the horn coming out. If you can't pick these people out, forget opera, think about optometry, maybe that?s more you're thing.
We're dead.
We're not dead.
We are dead.
Come on. We got all day tomorrow to come up with a story.
All day tomorrow? We had a month and a half to come up with something and we didn't do anything.
So we'll do it tomorrow.
Let me ask you something. When's the last time you went skiing?
About six years ago.
I think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now.
Women like skiers.
So what? You can't meet anybody. You're going on with Susan.
Yeah. Right.
Hey, see those two women over there? I almost dated the one on the right. She's in the closet business.
The closet business? What's the closet business?
What is it your business?
I'm interested.
She reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize your closet space. She looked into my closet.
So you thought she was good looking and figured this would be a good way to meet her.
Yeah.
Yeah. So what happened?
So, she mentioned she had a boyfriend and then it hit me. What do I need more closet space for? (Across the room) Hi, Marla.
(Walks over to Jerry and George) Jerry.
George, Marla.
Marla.
George. Jerry, Stacey.
Stacey.
Jerry.
George, Stacey.
Stacey.
George.
George.
Jerry. Marla. (Realizing Jerry's cue) Stacey! (Walks over to Stacey)
So, how was your trip to Berlin?
Trip to Berlin?
Remember? That's why you put off doing the closets. You said you were going to Berlin for a while.
Oh, right, right.
The wall had just come down, and you told me you wanted to be part of the celebration.
Yes, yes, I did. But, you know, I was watching it on CNN, and they covered it so well I thought, "Why knock my brains out?"
You, know my boyfriend went.
Really?
Yes, I told him all about you going and he got all excited and decided to go.
Oh, did he like it?
I don't know. He never came back. (Over to the other side of the bar)
Anyway, we met with NBC about a month ago and they gave us the green light to go ahead and write a pilot. In fact, we got a big meeting with them tomorrow. They gotta approve of the story before we can write.
Wow, what a great job. A writer.
Not a bad way to make a buck.
Sounds great.
Well, I'll tell you, Stacey. It's a lot of hard work. But, it comes fairly easy to me. Some people write symphonies. This is my gift. (Raises ski lift ticket while Stacey looks away)
So, are you gonna go out with her?
I might.
What about Susan?
What? I'm not married. I'm not allowed to go out with somebody else?
Depends.
Depends on what?
On many factors.
Like what?
Well, how long you've been seeing her. What's your phone call frequency? Are you on a daily?
No. Semi-daily. Four or five times a week.
What about Saturday nights? Do you have to ask her out, or is a date implied?
Implied.
She got anything in your medicine cabinet?
There might be some moisturizer.
Ah hah. Let me ask you this. Is there any tampax in your house?
(Pause) Yeah.
Well, I'll tell you what you've got here.
What?
You got yourself a girlfriend.
Ah, no, no. Are you sure? A girlfriend?
I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily with tampax in his house and an implied date on Saturday night. I would like to help you out, but...
Would you believe my luck? The first time in my life I have a good answer to the question, "What do you do?" and I have a girlfriend. I mean, you don't need a girlfriend when you can answer that question. That's what you say in order to get girlfriends. Once you can get a girlfriend, you don't want a girlfriend, you just want more girlfriends.
You're going to make a good father someday.
Well it's not fair, Jerry. It's just not fair. All right, all right. That's it. I'm getting out of this thing.
Fine. Break up with her. But you know what this means?
No, what?
The script, the pilot, the TV show. That's all over.
Why? What do you mean?
Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna pick us up?
Oh, right. Oh no, man.
you know, it's a very interesting situation. Here you have a job that can get you girls. But, you also have a relationship. But if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the girls, you lose the job. You see the irony?
Yeah, yeah. I see the irony. All right. What about this? What if I can find some way to break up with her so that she'll still like me and it doesn't affect the deal.
(sarcastically) Oh, yeah.
Wait, wait. Here me out. Don't dismiss this. You're very quick to dismiss. Don't dismiss. She's got a big crush on David Letterman, I mean, a big crush. She talks about him all the time. Suppose I go up to David Letterman. He works at NBC; I work at NBC. I explain my situation. He agrees to meet her. They go out, they fall madly in love. And she dumps me for David Letterman.
This is your plan?
No, no. I'm just thinking.
I don't think you are.
Let me tell you what I think.
Please, and be brutal. I have no closet sensitivity.
Are you very fussy about your pants?
I don't think I am.
Because I have a very radical idea. Can you handle it?
Try me.
Here's what I'm proposing. We eliminate all this. The hangers, the bar, the shelves. And in its place install a series of hooks. We'll put everything on hooks.
Everything?
Everything. The shirts, pants, sport jackets, pajamas. We could get eighty hooks on here.
You're quite mad, you know. (Kramer enters) Oh, I don't believe this. (Goes into other room) Hey?
Hey.
What are you doing?
I'm watching The Bold and the Beautiful.
No.
What?
This is not a good time.
Five minutes. What?
What did you have to give your TV away to George for?
Because I've been watching too much. It was an addiction. I couldn't stop. It was, it was destroying my brain cells.
Yeah, but now you're in here all the time. (Marla enters from other room)
Well, wow.
Marla, Kramer.
Hey.
Why don't you go out? It's nice out.
Oh, no. There's nothing out there for me.
There's weather.
Weather? I don't need weather. Weather doesn't do it for me.
I'm tellin' George to give you your TV back.
No, no, I don't want it back. (Pause) Are you gonna watch the Knick game tonight?
I don't know.
Will you tape it?
Kramer... (points to Marla)
Yeah. (He exits)
So your boyfriend never came back from Berlin.
Never came back.
Oh, you must have been devastated being left for a wall.
It was about to end anyway. There was this... problem.
Ah hah. (Buzzer) Excuse me one second. Yeah?
It's me.
Come on up. Oh, it's Elaine, she's just a friend of mine. I don't know what she's doing here now. (Buzzer) I'm sorry. What?
I didn't get it.
Ugh. So you were saying there was this problem.
Well, he wanted me to move in with him.
Snapple?
No thanks.
Go on.
Well I wouldn't move in because...
Yes.
Well because...
Yeah.
Well because I'm a virgin. (Elaine enters)
Hello!
Hi, um. Marla, Elaine.
I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. I just wanted to return your tape.
Oh, thanks a lot, two weeks late. Now that costs me thirty-five dollars to see Havana.
I'm sorry, I really am. I just kept forgetting.
I should be going.
No, no, I'm leaving.
I like that thing in your hair there.
Oh yeah? This woman was selling them at this crazy party I was at last night. You'll appreciate this. Snapple?
No thanks.
I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened to throw my purse on the sofa. And my diaphragm goes flying out. So I just froze, you know, ahh! Staring at my diaphragm. You know, it's just lying there. So then, this woman, the one who sold me this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy noticed, so. I mean, big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? Yeah, like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms. You never know when you're gonna need it, right? (Sips the Snapple) Ahh.
I should be going.
So we'll talk about the hooks then?
Yes. (She exits)
What? Was it something I said?
She's a virgin, she just told me.
Well I didn't know.
Well it's not like spotting a toupee.
Well you think I should say something? Should I say something? Should I apologize? Was I being anti-virgin?
No, no, I mean...
'Cause I'm not anti-virgin. I'll be right back. (She leaves)
Elaine, Elaine... (Buzzer) Yeah?
It's George.
She's a virgin?
A virgin.
Wow. So what're you gonna do?
I don't know. I'm very attracted to her. That accent, it's so sexy.
I don't think I could do it. You know, they always remember the first time. I don't want to be remembered. I wanna be forgotten.
You need a little pioneer spirit. You know, you don't have any of that Lewis and Clark in you.
You know, sometimes those guys don't make it back. (Looks in fridge) I'm really hungry.
Yeah, me too.
We gotta get something. I don't want to go to that meeting on an empty stomach. Let's get some Chinese. You wanna order it?
All right, but then we gotta get some work done. Let me just call Kramer, see if want anything. (Calls) Hey, we ordering Chinese food. If you want anything-- (Kramer enters quickly) let me know what it is and I'll order for you.
I'm in. Let's go for it.
What do you want?
I don't care, whatever.
I'll tell you what. Why don't we just get a couple of dishes and we'll just share 'em.
Okay. What are you getting?
I'm gonna get a Chow Fung.
What's a Chow Fung?
It's a broad noodle.
What do you mean, a broad noodle?
It's a big flat noodle.
Well I don't want a big flat noodle.
What kind of noodle do you want?
Who says I want a noodle?
All right, look. I'm getting the Chow Fung. You don't have to have any.
All right. I'll get pea pods and you can't have any of my pea pods.
Fine.
Get extra MSG.
Look, Marla. This whole sex thing is totally overrated. Now, here's the one thing you've gotta be ready for is how the man changes into a completely different person five seconds after it's over. I mean, something happens to their personality it's really quite astounding. It's like they committed a crime and they want to flee the scene before the police get there.
So they just leave?
Yeah, pretty much, yeah. Well, the smart ones start working on their getaway stories during dinner. How, you know, they gotta get up early tomorrow. What is about being up early? They all turn into farmers suddenly.
Wow. It must be pretty good to put up with all that.
Eh.
All right, let's go. We don't have much time before the meeting.
Where's the food? What happened to Ping?
Don't worry, he'll be here. Look, we only got about two hours. We just need to come up with one good story so we can get through this meeting. (Buzzer) There's your food.
Hey, what about this? I'm in a car accident. The motorist is uninsured, you with me?
Yeah.
My car's totaled. It's all his fault and now, he has absolutely no money. There is no way that he can pay me. So the judge decrees that he becomes my butler.
Your butler?
Right. He cooks my food, he cleans my house, he does all my shopping for me. And there you go, that's your program.
What about me?
Don't worry, we'll find something for you. (Knock of Jerry's door)
(Getting the door) That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. Sentenced to be a butler. (Elaine, Marla, and an injured Ping are at the door) Ping, what happened?
There was a bit of an accident.
Head hurts. Head really hurts.
What happened?
Marla and I went out for coffee and afterwards I was crossing the street and he was biking right towards me. So I got out of the way just in time, but then he ran into a parked car. He hit his head and everything went flying.
Something happened to the food?
I only saved one bag.
Should I call an ambulance? Do you wanna see a doctor?
I'll get some ice.
(After looking in the bag) The pea pods? All you saved was the pea pods? (Kramer enters)
Hey, you got the food?
Yeah, here.
What took you so long? Hey, Ping!
Kramer. (Kramer and George sit on the couch)
Yeah. Where's yours?
He dropped it.
Oh, that's too bad.
You should slow down, you know that? It's dangerous to go that fast.
No, no. I have green light. You jaywalked.
(To Jerry) Hey, you watchin' Oprah?
(To Ping) I did not jaywalk.
(To George) You're givin' him back that TV.
(To Elaine) Yes, you jaywalked.
(To Jerry) No, I don't want it back.
(To Elaine) Jaywalker. I could slap suit on you.
(To Jerry) We got work to do. What about the meeting?
(To himself) Hey, look. An hour with Patrick Swayze.
A month and a half we had. We did nothing. I can't believe we put it off until today and then we couldn't do anything because Elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin, crosses against a light, and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. Now we're gonna make fools of ourselves, we got nothing. You're not even in show business. I gotta reputation. You drag me into the sewer with you. I've been on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word spreads in show business? It's like that (Snaps in George's face) , like that! One bad impression, you're outta the business!
All right, let's postpone it. Let's get out of here.
What do you mean? They know we're here.
I'll fake an illness. (Acts it out) My back! My back! I can't believe, my back.
No, no, would you get up?
I can do this, Jerry.
No.
All right, I'll tell them my sister died. (Starts fake crying) My poor sister died. She was standing and then she was laughing and then they SHOT her! That's the kind of sick city that we're livin' in. They shoot you for laughing. I must go and comfort my poor family. Jerry, take me home so I can comfort my... my poor family.
What?
That's David Letterman. I just saw David Letterman walk by. I'll be right back. (He exits)
Mr. Seinfeld, they're ready for you. (She exits)
Yes, I was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star. (Jerry enters meeting)
Hey, Jerry.
Hi, how are you doing? Nice to see you all here. Hello.
Hello, Jerry. I'm Rita Kearson.
Oh, uh, nice to meet you. Where's Russell?
He, uh, had to go to LA. There's a problem on the set of Blossom.
Oh, poor Blossom. (He sits)
Anyway, he asked me to sit in for him.
Where's George?
Oh, he ran to say something to David Letterman.
David Letterman's on the floor?
Yeah, he just walked by.
Well, I think we should get started anyway.
Yeah, good idea.
So how are you guys comin' along?
Good, good, we've got a lot of ideas.
Good. (Pause)
Have you ever been to a Chinese restaurant and they tell you it'll be, like, five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin' there for, like, thirty minutes? Well, we thought it would be very funny to do an entire show where all you're doin' is waitin' for the table. (They don't seem to like it) Because we've all been in that situation. You know, you're waiting... and you're hungry... and you bump into somebody you know... When is Russell coming back?
So that's the idea?
Well no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance and the judge sentences him to be my butler. (Everyone laughs) You know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house, he's doin' my shopping, you know? I'm walkin' around with one of those big neck collars.
Those collars are funny!
Once you see someone in those collars you start laughing immediately. (George enters)
You tellin' 'em about the butler story? Is that beautiful or what? Hey, sorry I'm late. (Looks at Rita) Russell?
I'm Rita Kearson.
Oh, Rita. Hey, Mr. Shermack, how're you doing, good to see you. Jay, always a pleasure. (To Susan) Sweetie. (Kisses her and then sits down next to Jerry) Yeah, yeah, that butler idea, that's beautiful. Isn't that killer? (Aside to Jerry) I thought I was getting the butler.
Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you.
So Letterman didn't spark to your idea, huh?
No, he said there was nothing he could do, and next time I should probably break the Prozacs in half.
You, you guys wanna hold it down? I'm watchin' Jeopardy.
Would you give him the TV back?
Oh, by the way, George. Susan called for you a minute ago.
I bet they're probably doing summersaults about us over there. You think they get butler stories like that everyday? (He calls Susan)
(To the TV) Who is Joseph Cotton? Giddee up!
Hello?
Hi, it's me. It's Georgie Boy. What's going on?
What's going on? What's going on? I'll tell you what's going on. I'm fired!
Fired? Why?
Because you kissed me. You kissed me, you stupid idiot! Rita called Russell and he fired me over the phone.
(To the TV) What is pi? Ooh! Giddee up again.
But I had no... I didn't realize.
You didn't realize? How could you not realize? You're stupid! You're a stupid, stupid man!
I just feel terrible This is just terrible.
(To the TV once again) What is the cha-cha? Ooh, yes indeed.
I'll speak to you later.
(Hangs up phone and pauses) this is great! He fired her! This is incredible, he fired her. I'm out, baby! I'm out!
Why did he fire her?
Because I kissed her in the meeting. Russell found out, he fired her over the phone. Finally, my stupidity pays off!
What is here comes the judge, here comes the judge!
You can't break up with her now. Her life is shattered. You got her fired. You gotta be there for her.
What?
You gotta at least wait until she gets another job.
Another job?
Couple of interviews.
Oh, this is unbelievable. I'm stuck. Every time I think I'm out, they pull me back in.
Are you gonna leave after its over? You know, if we have sex.
What? Leave? Where? Why?
You know, the apartment.
Why would I leave? This is my apartment.
Well what if it was my apartment?
Who gave you this idea I would wanna leave?
Well Elaine said men like to leave after it's over.
Listen, I wouldn't put too much stock into what Elaine has to say about relationships. She comes from a broken home, and I mean that literally. A tree fell on her roof and cracked the whole structure. Her parents got along beautifully, but her house was in bad shape.
Maybe I should get going.
What else did you say to her?
Nothin'. I was just givin' her the straight dope.
More like a dope was giving it to her straight. Another cup of coffee with you, she'll wind up in a convent.
Listen, there was a lot more I could've told her, believe me.
What is that about leaving after sex? Did I ever leave with you?
You might've if I'd stayed. So you know what? I got served with papers today. Ping is suing me. I need your virgin as a witness. You better be nice to her.
I was trying to be.
Look at George. (On the other side of the restaurant) He lucked out, huh?
Oh, you're not kiddin'. Who'd 've figured Susan would break up with him? They had a good thing going.
Yeah, since she met him she's been vomited on, her family cabin's been burned down, she learned her father's a homosexual, and she got fired from a high paying network job. Yeah, they had a real good thing going.
What do I do? Well actually, I'm a writer. In fact, I'm writing a comedy pilot for NBC right now.
A sitcom? How can you write that crap? Carol, this guy's writing a sitcom.
A sitcom? Come on, let's go. (They leave)
A sitcom. Can you imagine? And he actually tried to use it to hit on me!
Monk's Coffee shop]
(To Elaine) Let me ask you a question.
Mm-hm.
You're a hostage, captured by terrorists-
(Smiling, chewing) Who, me?
You, anybody - whatever. You're in the little room, you're chained to the floor, you're there for a long time.. do you think they would ever consider doing the laundry?
(Matter-of-factly) They have to, it's in the Geneva Convention.
(Imitating a Turkish terrorist) You! Take off your socks, your pants, your underwear. We're doing the wash. C'mon! Take it off, take it off!
Hey, Georgie.
Hi.
(To George) What's the matter?
(Slowly shakes his head) My mother caught me.
"Caught" you? Doing what?
You know. (All three give him blank stares) I was alone..
(Making a face of surprise) You mean..?!
(Nods) Uh-huh.
(Laughing) She caught you?
Where?
(Not really wanting to embellish) ..I stopped by the house to drop the car off, and I went inside for a few minutes.. Nobody was there - they're supposed to be working. (Jerry and Elaine look at each other - enjoying the story) My mother had a Glamour magazine, I started leafing through it..
"Glamour"?
..So, one thing lead to another..
So, what did she do?
First she screams, "George, what are you doing?! My God!" And it looked like she was gonna faint - she started clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it.
(Reflecting on the story so far) Man..
I didn't know whether to try and keep her from falling, or zip up.
What did you do?
I zipped up!
(Wide-eyed) So, she fell?
Yeah. (Noticing this makes him out to be the bad kid, he gets defensive) Well, I couldn't run over there the way I was!
No, I guess you couldn't have..
(In the middle of Elaine's sentence, smiling) No, I wouldn't think so.
(Finishing it off) ..done that.
So, she fell, and then she started screaming, "My back! My back!" So, I picked her up and took her to the hospital.
(Between chuckles) How is she?
(Somewhat angered) She's in traction.
(Still laughing) Ok, I'm sorry.
It's not funny, Elaine.
(Stifling her laughter) I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious.
Her back went out. She's gotta be there for a couple of days. All she said on the way over in the car was, "Why, George, why?!".. I said, "Because it's there!"
"Glamour"?
(Vowing) Well, I'll tell you this, though - I am never doing.. that , again.
What, you mean, in your mother's house, or all together?
(Definite) All together.
Oh, gimme a break..
(Skeptical) Ohhh yeah.. right.
Oh, like you're gonna stop?
C'mon..
You don't think I can?
No chance.
(Daring) You think you could?
Well, I know I could hold out longer than you.
Care to make it interesting?
Sure, how much?
A hundred dollars.
(Pointing) You're on.
(Butting in) Wait a second, wait a second. Count me in on this. (Clicks his tongue)
You?
Yeah.
You'll be out before we get the check.
(Smiling) I want to be in on this, too.
(Rejecting) Ohh, no. No, no, no..
Why?
(Showing difference) It's apples and oranges..
What? Why? (More 'no, no, no's from Jerry and George. Persistent) Why?
Because you're a woman!
So what?
It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man.
(Sarcastic) Oh.
We have to do it. It's part of our lifestyle. It's like, uh.. shaving.
Oh, that is such bologna. I shave my legs.
(Making a point) Not everyday.
Alright, look, you want to be in?
Yeah!
You gotta give us odds. At least two to one - you gotta put up two-hundred dollars.
No, a thousand!
No, I'll - I'll put up one-fifty.
Alright, you're in for one-fifty.
(Nodding) Okay, one-fifty.
Alright, now, how are we gonna monitor this thing?
Well, obviously, we all know each other very well, (Elaine slightly laughs) I'm sure that we'll all feel comfortable within the confines of the honor system.
Alright. (Holds out his pinkie at the center of the table)
Jerry's apartment]
(Stern) No, ma, I'm not gonna see a psychiatrist. N- I don't care if you do pay for it! No! Discussion over. Yeah, alright, I'll see you later. Yes, of course I'm gonna come by. Alright. (Hangs up, slamming it down on the coffee table. He sits down next to Jerry) My mother wants me to see a psychiatrist now. Why?! Because she caught me? (Scoffs, shaking his head) You know, if everyone who did that had to go see a psychiatrist.. (Laughing, he snorts)
(Waits for the rest of the sentence) ..Yeah?
(Defensively) Whatever.
How is she?
(Shrugging it off) She'll be fine. I gotta go to the hospital to see her tonight.
(Answering to the intercom) Yeah?
It's me.
Come on up. (Lets her in by unlocking the front door)
Hey, what are you doing tonight?
(Opens his door slightly for Elaine) Dating Marla.
Oh, the virgin?
Yeah.
Any, uh.. progress, there? What's the latest?
Well, I got my troops amassed along the border - I'm just waiting for someone to give me the go-ahead.
Hey, look at this, c'mere. There's a naked woman across the street.
Where?
Second floor from the top. (Pointing) See the window on the left?
(In awe) Wow!
(Also amazed) Who walks around the house like that?!
(Suggesting) Maybe she's a nudist. You know, those nudist colony people..
..Yeah.. (Pause) yeah.. (Slowly stands up, and walks out Jerry's apartment - leaving Jerry and George with the view, he shuts the door behind him)
Hey, let me ask you a question. In these nudist colonies, do they eat naked in the dining room?
I would imagine it's all naked.
What about the chamber maids? Are they naked, too?
(Still focused on the nudist) They're naked, the gardeners naked.. the bellhops. (Jerry makes a noise of astonishment) One big nude-a-rama.
Hey.
(Only turning back for a second) Hey.
Well, (Smiling) where's my money? Who caved?
(Over his shoulder) Not me.
(Also, over his shoulder) Not me.
What're you looking at?
There's a naked woman across the street.
(Smiling, chuckling) This is gonna be the easiest money I've ever made in my life. (Moving on to a new topic) So, my fried, Joyce, is teaching an aerobics class. I'm gonna go tonight.
(Commenting) Yeah.. the - the waitress should've taken it back.
(Realizes Jerry and George aren't paying attention) So then, I got a call this morning. You know, I was, uh, chosen to go on the space shuttle. We're goin' to Mars.
(Still staring at the woman) Uh-huh.
Have a good time.
(Declaring) I'm out!
What?!
Yeah, I'm out - I'm out of the contest.
You're out?!
Yeah, yeah.. (Notes their reactions) what?
Well, that was fast!
Well, it was that woman across the street. (To Jerry) You know, you better be careful, buddy. She's gonna get you next. (Walks out, shutting the door behind him)
..And then there were three.
Hospital room]
I don't understand you. I really don't. You have nothing better to do at three o' clock in the afternoon? I go out for a quart of milk, I come home, and find my son treating his body like it was an amusement park!
(Stern, trying to shut her up) Ma.
Don't give me "Ma". It's a good thing I didn't hit the table. I could of cracked my head open.
Ma, people can hear you.
(Heavy in sarcasm) Too bad you can't do that for a living. You'd be very successful at it. You could sell out Madison Square Garden. Thousands of people could watch you! You could be a big star!
(Getting up) Alright, Ma, that's enough!
I want you to go see a psychiatrist.
No! I am not going to see a psychiatrist!
Why? Why not?! Why won't you go?
(Like a kid) Because I don't want to.
I want you to go see somebody.
Well, I am not going.
It's a good thing your father's in Chicago.
Hello, Aunt Estelle. Look at you - how did this happen?
(Snapping) Is that important, really? What is this, a police investigation? The woman's been through enough. She has to relive the experience now?!
Hi, Denise. Six-thirty, time for your sponge bath.
Mmm.. is it six-thirty already? I fell asleep.
(Seems not to notice what's going on beyond the divider) So, George, what are you doing now? I hear you got some kinda television, writing - thing?
(Slowly backing away, he's not at all committed to the conversation) Yeah.. television.
Let me help you out with that. Here, just slip it over your head..
Oh.. thank you.
(Nodding) Well, it's about time. We thought you were gonna wind up on the street. (As the bath is going on, George is now completely mesmerized) What is it you're doing, exactly?
George, you're cousin, Shelly, is talking to you!
New York Health Club]
So, when was the last time you took a class?
Oh, it's been a while.
(Overly excited) Are you psyched?
(Fake excitement) Yeah. yeah, I'm really.. psyched.
Well, you're gonna thank me for getting you in here.
Why is that?
(Pointing, she directs Elaine's attention off-camera) See the guy with the dark hair and the red shorts?
(Between breaths) Oh, my God. (Joyce nods) John F. Kennedy Junior's here!
He's gonna be in your class today.
(Still unable to speak right) In my class? John Kennedy's gonna be in my class?!
I can get you a spot right behind him. He has got a great butt.
Yeah. Butt. Butt. Great butt. John-John's butt.
Jerry's car]
Let's slow it down a little.
"Slow it down"?
Well, (Reminding him of her virginity) You know..
Ah, yeah.. I know.
You're okay with that, right?
Yeah, yeah.. of course. What, do you think I care about the sex? What kind of person do you think I am? That doesn't mean anything to me. (Faint) I don't care about that.
So, I'll see you Saturday night, then?
(Smiling, nodding) Sure, Saturday night.
Alright, then. Good night.
Goodnight. (She gets out. Jerry leans forward, adding) Not just a good night - a great night. (She shuts the door, he waves)
Jerry's bedroom]
Jerry's apartment]
(Singing) Goood Moorrrnninng!
(Out of it) Yeah, good morning.
Ha, ha! Nothing like some good solid sack time. (Turns toward Jerry's window)
She's not there. She's doin' her wash.
(Turning back to Jerry) Oh. So, did you make it through the night?
(Over the top) Yes, I'm proud to say I did!
So, you're still master of your domain.
(Nodding) Yes. Yes I am. (Kramer chuckles) Master of my domain. But I will tell you this I am going over to (Gestures to the nudist) her apartment, and I'm tellin' her to put those shades down!
Woah, woah, woah. What-what did you just say?
I can't take it anymore! She's driving me crazy! I can't sleep, I can't leave the house, and I' here, I'm climbin' the walls. Meanwhile, I'm dating a virgin, I'm in this contest - something's gotta give!
Do you hear what you're saying?! Can you hear it?! (Jerry puts on his coat) This is a beautiful woman walking around naked, and you want to tell her to stop?! That's the dumbest thing I ever heard! I mean, think comprehens- I'm not gonna let you do it.
(Persistent) Well, I'm doin' it, get out of my way.
(Stopping him) No, no, no, no. You can't! You can't! This is something that comes about once in a lifetime! When we were boys, looking through our bedroom windows, we would think "Why can't there be a woman out there, taking her clothes off?" And now that wish's come true, and you want to (Makes a noise) throw it away?!
Look, I'm sorry-
No, I'm not gonna let you do it, Jerry.
Kramer, (Trying to pass him) get outta my way!
(Frantic) No, no, no. Don't do it. Don't do it! For my sake! God knows I don't ask you for much! (Pleading) Now, come on. Please, Jerry. Please! I'm beggin' ya! Please! (Claps hands) Come on! Please!
Alright.. (Takes his coat off)
Yes!
..Alright.
(Moving to the window) Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Sits in Jerry's chair, looking out the window)
She's not there!
Oh, I can wait..
Monk's Coffee shop]
So the nurse was giving her a sponge bath?
Every night at six-thirty. The nurse was gorgeous.. then I got a look at the patient.. (Laughs, then snorts) I was going nuts.
Oh, man. Well, I guess you'll be going back to that hospital.
(Fake sympathy) Well, my mother, Jerry..
(Pointing) But are you still master of your domain?
(Arms out) I am king of the county. You?
Lord of the manor.
John F. Kennedy Jun-ya!
What?
(Smiling) He was in my aerobics class.
Really? Did you talk to him?
No, you don't understand - he was working out right in front of me. So, listen, after the class was over, I timed my walk to the door so we'd get there at the exact same moment, and he says to me, (Thinking the world of what he said) "Quite a workout."
"Quite a workout"? What did you say?
(Smiling, proud) I said, "yeah."
(Adding, fake praise) Good one.
So then, listen, listen. So then, I showered and I dressed, and I saw him again, on the way out. (Giddy and nearly out of breath) So we're walkin' and talkin', and he asked me my name - and I think I said Elaine - but, I mean, who the hell knows.. And so then, he says to me "Do you wanna split a cab uptown?" And I said, "Sure" - even though I was going downtown. So, we get in the cab, and I mean, I have no idea where I'm goin', right? But this is John F. Kennedy Junior we're talkin' about! (Deep breath) So, then, he says to me, "Where do you live?" And I - and I - and I was close to your block, so I said your building. So he dropped me off in front, (Laughs) and I had to take a cab all the way back downtown to my house.. (Picks up a glass of cold water and presses it up to her forehead to cool her off) Oh, God..
But the question is, are you still master of your domain?
(Sets the glass down) I'm queen of the castle. (Pops a piece of food into her mouth)
Estelle's hospital room]
You're back.
Of course I'm back. Why wouldn't I be back? My mother's in the hospital, I'm going to pay her a visit.
I know, but two days in a row? You didn't have to do this.
You're my mother! What wouldn't I do for you?
You know what you could do? I haven't eaten lunch or dinner. I can't eat this hospital food. Maybe you could run down to the deli and get me a sandwich..
(Smiling) You got it, Ma. (She smiles back, nodding) A little later. (George sits back in a nearby chair, looking at the divider in anticipation)
(Let down) Could you go now, George? I'm very hungry. I'm weak.
Well, wait a little while, Ma. What's the difference?
I don't understand why you can't do this for me!
(Standing up) I just got here, Ma! I'd like to spend a little time with you.
But if you wait, they won't let you back in! Visiting hours are almost over!
Ten minutes! Here, here, (Fishes a box of Tic-Tacs out of his coat pocket and tosses them to her) Have some Tic-Tacs.
Get the hell outta here. (Angrily sets them aside) I'm sorry you came.
(To patient) Six-thirty. Time for your sponge bath.
George.. I'm huuunnnggry!
(Muttering, slow) Hang on, Ma.. hang on..
New York Health Club]
Hi!
Hi.
Did you get your hair done today?
No, I just, uh, fixed it.. a little bit. (Still looking around, she quickly checks her breath)
You know who - isn't here. He was in the early class today. (Elaine looses her composure) But I think you made quite an impression on him yesterday.
(Regarding herself) What? What? Who? Me-me-me? I made an impression? What impression?
Let me just put this back. (Turns to put a stack of shorts away)
No! No! Now! Tell me now! What did he say?!
(Uneasy) He asked about you.
(Ecstatic) He asked about me? John Kennedy asked about me?! (Hangs off the side of the counter, both feet in the air) What did he say?
He wanted to know your situation.
(Quick) What situation? I have a situation?
I-I told him you were single.
That was good. That was very good.
He said you were just his type.
(Frank) Okay, you tryin' to hurt me? Are you tryin' to hurt - you're tryin' to injure me, right? You're trying to hurt me.
He also told me to tell you that he'll be in your neighborhood tomorrow around nine o' clock - so he's gonna stop in front of your building if you want to come down and say hello.
Jerry's apartment]
Alright, Ma, I'll talk to you later.. Nothing, I'm, I'm watching, uh, Tiny Toons here, on Nickelodeon.. It's, I-I like kid shows. They have a very innocent, wholesome quality. Okay, alright, I'll talk to you later. Bye. (Hangs up)
(Obviously watching the nudist across the street) Oh, that's good. That's good. That's very, very good. Oh, it's hot in there.. (Jerry looks back at Kramer in envy) It's hot in there. So, just walk around a little bit. Don't be ashamed, don't be ashamed.. that's good, that's good.. yes, yes, yes..
(Trying to block out Kramer, he starts to sing along with the TV) The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round and round. The wheels on the bus..
The woman across the street has nothing on, nothing on, nothing on..
George's room]
Jerry's apartment]
All you got is instant coffee? Why don't you get some real coffee?
I don't keep real coffee in here, I get my coffee on the outside! (Intercom buzzes. He answers it) Yeah?!
(Through intercom) It's Elaine.
(Shouting) Come on up! (Opens his door for Elaine)
Where did you get those socks?
I don't know.
I think those are my socks!
How are these your socks?!
I don't know, but those are my socks! I had a pair just like that with the blue stripe, and now I don't have them anymore!
(Sarcastic) Oh, yeah, that's right, well, you fell asleep one day on the sofa and I took them off your stinkin' feet. They looked so good to me, I just had to have them!
Yeah, well, they're my socks!
They're my socks!
Oh boy..
What are we doing here..
..Oh boy.
This is ridiculous.
Do you believe this? We're fighting. We're fighting.
I haven't been myself lately. I've been snapping at everybody.
Me too. I've been yelling at strangers on the street.
Hello.. (Pulls a wad of bills out of her purse, and starts to count it up)
(Shocked) You caved?!
It's over?
You're out?
Ohh-my-God. The Queen is dead.
I figured you'd cruise. At least through the Spring.
What happened?
It was..uh.. John-John.
Ohhhhh.. John-John.
But you made it through the day before.
Yeah, but yesterday, he told Joyce, the aerobics teacher, that he wants to meet me outside here at nine o' clock tonight.
Why outside here?
Because he think I live here. Remember when we shared a cab, and he dropped me off out in front? He's picking me up.
Alright, Costanza - it's just you and me.
And then, (Smacks the money) there were two.
(Slowly) Elaine Benes Kennedy Junior..
Jerry's apartment]
Let's go in the bedroom.
Really?
Yes.
You sure?
Yes.
You really want to?
I do. I'm ready.
Okay..
I know how difficult this must have been for you.
(Chuckles) You don't know the half of it.
What do you mean?
Well, it's kinda silly, but..
Contest?! A contest! This is what you do with your friends?
No, it was just a bet. I mean, it actually started with George and his mother-
I don't want to hear another word. And to think how close I came to you being the one! I must have been out of my mind.
Marla? Hi, oh, I'm glad I ran into you-
I don't want to have anything to do with you or your perverted friends. (Confused, Elaine moves closer) Ooohh, get away from me! You're horrible.
Jerry's apartment]
What happened?
I told her about the contest.
Ohh. Boy, she's a whack-o.
(To Elaine) Hey, what happened?
What?
I thought you were meeting Kennedy.
(Let down) He didn't show.
Yeah, he did.
What? He's - He's out there? Oh, my God. I-I gotta go, I gotta go..
No, no, no. He just left.
What?
Yeah, he was talking to Marla.
Marla?
Yeah, I think, you know, she was, like, crying, and he was consoling her, and then, she, uh, just got into his car, and they just drove away.
(Angered) He left with Marla, the virgin?
Yeah.
They drove away?
Yeah, drove away.. You know, I said 'Hello' to him. You know, he's - he's-
(Moving to the window, shocked) Oh my God in heaven!
(Makes a sound of surprise) Is that..?
Kramer?!
He's waving..
Elaine's bedroom]
Ohh, John. That was wonderful..
Bah bah baaah, Boo doo bah bah bah, boo doo waaaah, waah, waaaah...
Hey, could you do me a favour? [pause] Could you shut-up?
Hey guess what? This window doesn't work.
I hate rental cars. Nothin' ever works the window doesn't work, the radio doesn't work... and it smells like a cheap hooker... [pause] Or is that you?
Gimme ten bucks and find out...
So, this worked out pretty good. Them givin' me an extra ticket, y'know, you get a free trip to St. Louis, I did my gig, you got to see your sister...
Yeah, worked out good.
And here's the beauty--
What?
George is pickin' us up at the airport.
Get out of here! Why?
You know that awning outside my building?
Yeah...
He's always bragging about his vertical leap, so I bet him fifty bucks that he couldn't touch the awning.
So what happened?
He didn't come within two feet of the thing. He's wavin at it... So, I told him if he picks us up at the airport, he wouldn't have to pay me anything.
Hey, how we doin' on time?
Timed out perfectly. Drop off the car, pick up the rental car shuttle, we walk right on the plane...
Hey! Wait up!
Hey! Wait up!
Sorry. Heh heh heh...
Where you goin'?
Uh, JFK. [To Elaine] I need some small bills for a tip. You got anything?
Yeah, you want five?
Gimme ten.
You're giving him *ten* dollars?
Well, we got three bags.
That's a pretty big tip...
That's what they get!
They don't get that much.
Let's ask him.
We can't ask him...
Let's see what he says.
Jerry, we don't have time for this...
Two seconds. [To Skycap] Excuse me, my friend and I here, we were having a discussion and we were wondering what you usually get for a tip.
Depends on the person, depends on the bag.
Uh, how about a couple of people like us.
People like you? I wouldn't expect much, you don't even look like you know what you're doing...
C'mon, seriously...
Well, since you asked, usually, I get five dollars a bag.
What!?
That's right.
*Five* dollars a bag? I don't think so.
Look, you asked, I told you.
You got some nerve trying to take advantage of us...
All right, look, we're late. Thank you very much...
You're lucky I don't report you...
JFK...
...Honolulu.
Wait up!
You see? Never be late for a plane with a girl. 'Cuz a girl runs like a girl-- with the little steps and the arms flailing out... You wanna make this plane, you've gotta run like a man! Get your knees up!
The flight's been canceled?!?!
Everything into JFK's booked... No, wait-- I have two seats into Laguardia-- but they're not together. It's boarding right now.
We'll take 'em!
We're not going to sit together?
Well, so what? It's not that long-- you'll read.
Well, what about George? He's supposed to pick us up at Kennedy.
We'll call him...
There's no time.
No time? [To ticket lady] Is there time?
There's no time.
There's no time. All right, we'll call him from the plane.
I have one seat in first class, and one in coach. The price is the same since your flight was canceled.
)
I'll take the first class.
Jerry!
What?
Why should you get the first class?
Elaine, have you ever flown first class?
No.
All right then. See? You won't know what you're missing. I've flown first class, Elaine-- I can't go back to coach. I can't... I won't...
You flew here coach.
Yeah, that's a point...
All right, fine. I don't care. If the plane crashes, everybody in first class is going to die, anyway.
Yeah, I'm sure you'll live.
Third row right...
Oh, you're in here, sir. Welcome aboard.
Bon voyage, Lainey!
)
Oh, excuse me... Um, excuse me, miss, I think you're sitting in my seat...
I never check my bags-- I can't stand that wait in the baggage area.
Great... [To herself] Help me...
)
Excuse me, I think you're in my seat...
Oh, sorry... My mistake... [To himself] Thank... *you*!
Hey, thanks for coming with me.
Hey, what made you think you could touch that awning?
I confused it with another awning.
So how we doin' on time?
We're perfect. I timed this out so we would pull up at the terminal *exactly* 17 minutes after their flight is supposed to land. That gives them just enough time to get off the plane, pick up their bags and be walking *out* of the terminal as we roll up. I tell you, it's a thing of beauty. I can not express to you the feeling I get from a perfect airport pickup. (starts looking around) What's going on? What are you doing? The Long Island Expressway? What are you getting on the Long Island Expressway for? Do you know what the traffic will be like? This is a suicide mission!
Will you relax?!
Oh, I had it perfectly timed out the Grand Central, the Van Wyck! You destroyed my whole timing!
This is the best way to go!
Do you know what happens if I miss him? I don't get credit for the pickup and I lose my 50 bucks...
George, there's no traffic at this time. Now, come on, man...
Really?
If anything, we'll probably get there early. I'll have a chance to go to the Duty Free shop.
The Duty Free Shop? Duty Free is the biggest sucker deal in retail. Do you know how much duty is?
Duty.
Yeah, "duty". Do you know how much duty is?
No, I dunno how much duty is.
Duty is *nothing*. It's like sales tax...
I still like to stop at the duty free shop.
I like to stop at the duty free shop.
)
I like to stop at the duty free shop!
So, he says, ``squeeze your breasts together'', and I say, ``I thought this was an ad for shoes''...
Oh my...
Is that the new Esquire? Turn to page 146.
Wow! Coming out of the shower... It's a good thing they gave you that washcloth to cover yourself up... What is this an ad for?
See those wrinkled jeans slung over the chair? Way in the background, out of focus?
Uh-huh...
How does it look on your side? [Pause while George just stares at him] We'll get there...
Oh, look at this... He's sleeping and I have to go to the bathroom. Maybe he'll wake up soon. What if my kidneys burst? Is it worth it not to wake this man up to damage a major organ? I hope this disgusting slob appreciates what I'm doing for him... [To passenger on the other side of her, but still to herself] Yeah, make a little more noise with your gum-- that's helpful.

They're not here! You cost me fifty bucks!
Look at you! You run like a girl! Run like a man! Lift your knees!
Look, we're wasting our time here! We're a half-hour late, they've probably took it off the board already.
No, there it is, right there-- 133... and it's canceled.
Canceled? Do I still get credit for the pick up? I was here!
Ok, c'mon... let's go check over at the ticket counter.
Oh, there it is honey, gate 18A, 830... [He leaves]
Did you see that guy?
No... What guy?
That guy.. He was just...
Listen, you go over to the ticket counter, I'm going to go stop in the gift shop and pick up a copy of Time magazine. There's supposed to ba blurb about Jerry in it and I think he mentioned my name!
[still lost] I know that guy...
Gotta get my Time magazine... Never miss my Time magazine.
Yeah, get your magazine and let's get out of here.
Hey, I was gonna take that!
Gee, I'm sorry... I got here first.
I don't care when you got here, I want the magazine...
You don't understand, there's a *blurb* about me in this magazine!
A *blurb*?!? *You're* a blurb! Check out the cover, idiot!
All right, let's go...
I want the magazine!
Umm... No.
You know what I would do to you, if I wasn't in these shackles...
But you are Blanche... You *are* in the shackles. Oh, I can't wait to read my *Time* magazine! Laaaast copy, too. Maybe I'll read it tomorrow-- in the park! It's supposed to be a beeyootiful day! Have a nice life... sentence, that is!
They're on a different flight. They're scheduled to land in a half hour, only at Laguardia.
Laguardia? All right, let's go. C'mon...
Where do I know that guy from?
[To herself, loudly] Wake up, you human slug! Wake up! *Wake* *up*!! I can't hold it anymore! [To the slug out loud] Excuse me, I've gotta go to the bathroom...
Oh my... that *is* refreshing...
Would you care for some slippers?
Sounds lovely! [To Tia, motioning to put them on her] May I?
Please!
Why, It's a perfect fit. You must be Cinderella.
My name is not mentioned in this blurb...
It's Grossbard!
Who's Grossbard?
When I lived on Third avenue and 18th street 20 years ago, I had this roommate who was *always* behind in his rent. Then one month, he asks me to loan him his share of the rent-- 240 bucks! He took the cash and >pfffft< disappears. Well, I try to find him, I went to his girlfriend's house, even his family. Uh-uh. I never got the money back! He screwed me! And that's the guy-- John Grossbard!
Hey Kramer, c'mon-- it was 240 bucks twenty years ago...
No, I'm gonna turn around... I'm gonna get that guy...
No-no-no, Kramer. Kramer! Kramer! You *cannot* abandon people in the middle of an airport pickup! It's a binding social contract. We... we must go forward... not back.
``I open the door, like a *punch* in the *face*, the stench hits me--''. Elaine takes in a lungful of air and goes in. Brave little soldier.]
Tia, did you see all the flowers in that bathroom? It's like an English garden in there.
They're gardenias, mostly.
I thought I smelled lilac.
Yes, there are a few of those, too...
It's almost overwhelming...
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Due to equipment problems at the runway at Laguardia, we've been instructed by the tower to re-route and land at JFK. We apologize for any inconvenience...
[To anyone who'll listen] What'd he say? What'd he say?
Well, You're not gonna believe it...
What?
The plane's been re-routed *back* to Kennedy. We've got 45 minutes.
Let's go. Listen to the bell, Grossbard-- it tolls for thee.
We have some *delicious* Chateau Briande, my personal favourite. Or, if you prefer something lighter, a poached Dover sole in a delicate white wine sauce with just a *hint* of saffron.
Oh, saffron! That sounds good.
And today we're featuring wines from the *Tuscany* region...
Tuscany!
Hi. Can I get to my seat?
You're just gonna have to wait...
But you just passed it. I'm sitting right there next to that guy...
You're not supposed to get up during the food service.
Well, nobody *told* me that!
Look. This plane is *full*. I got a lot of people to serve. Now please... You're just gonna have to wait.
There it is. Gate 46... We got plenty of time.
Grossbard's plane leaves in ten minutes. I *still* got time to catch him!
How you gonna catch him? He's probably boarded the plane already.
Gimme your credit card.
My credit card?
Just gimme the card, don't ask me any questions.
I'm not gonna give you my card unless you tell me what it's for!
I'm gonna buy a ticket-- I'm gonna get on that flight.
What, are you, nuts? You're gonna spend more on the ticket than you're gonna get back from Grossbard.
No, I'm not gonna use the ticket! I'm gonna get my money, I'll get off the plane and turn your ticket in for a refund. It's not gonna cost you a dime! Now gimme the card.
This is a *great* idea! Here... use this one. I get frequent flyer miles with every purchase... Wait! Get two tickets. As long as your turning it in for a refund what's the difference? I'll get *double* the bonus miles.
Excuse me. I'm sorry to make you do this, but I got stuck in the aisle and the flight attendant wouldn't let me get through. There's no way to get around that cart...
You're not supposed to get up during the food service.
I'll try and remember that. [Pause] Where's my meal?
He asked me where you were, and you were gone so long I thought you, uh, switched seats.
Excuse me? Excuse me, but I didn't get a meal.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure! I would know if a tray of food had been served to me.
Would you? Well, the only meal left is a kosher meal.
Kosher meal? I don't want a kosher meal. I don't even know what a kosher meal is.
I think it means when a Rabbi has inspected it, or something.
No, no. It all has to do with the way they kill the pig.
They don't eat pigs!
They do if it's killed right-- under a Rabbi's supervision.
Oh, You know what? *I* ordered the kosher meal.
Then why didn't you take it?
I ordered it six weeks ago, I forgot.
You're eating my food!
Look, I got earplugs to collect. Do you want it, or not.
Mmmmmmmm!
This is the best sundae I've ever had.
Oh, man. You know what... they got the fudge on the bottom-- y'see? That enables you to control your fudge distribution as you're eatin' your ice cream.
I've never met a man who knew so much about nothing.
Thank you...
Mmmmmm!
More anything?
More everything!
Look, I got Super Savers! C'mon.
Super Savers? Are they refundable!?
You bought non-refundable tickets, you idiot!
She talked me in to it-- she said it was the best deal.
Do you know how much this is going to cost me?
Look, I'll tell you what-- I'll split it with you
Look, I'm gonna go to the bathroom...
Excuse me... Excuuuse me...
What? Oh, no... nothing for me thanks.
What is your name?
Elaine Benes?
[Checks her list] You're going to have to go back to coach.
No, but there was nobody sitting here...
Yes, but you're still not allowed. These seats are very expensive.
Oh, no, please, don't send me back there. Please, I'll do anything. It's so nice up here. It's so comfortable up here. I don't want to go back there. Please don't send me back there... [She notices another attendant offering goods] Oh, you got *cookies*!
You're going to have to go back to your seat!
Ok, fine. I'll go back... You know, our goal should be a society *without* *classes*! [She goes through the curtain to, ick, *coach*] Do you realise that the people up here are getting *cookies*!
What is all the racket back there? You know, you're trying to relax on the plane and this is what you have to put up with. [To attendant] What is going on?
Sir, this woman tried to *sneak* into first class.
Oh, you see, that's terrible. The problem is, that curtain is no security-- there really should be a locking door.
Hey! That guy owes me 240 bucks!
Couldn't be...
Where are they already? I don't see them anywhere... I got my bags, I'm ready to go.
Yeah, *you* got *your* bags...
The worst flight I have been on in my entire life.
Yeah, me too...
I'll call you.
Okay... [To a bamboozled Elaine] It's a business thing...
You guys ready?
Yeah. Where's George?
(can't be heard but looks like) Kramer!
I loved her Jerry, I loved her.
No, you didn't.
And she loved me. Hoo, ho, she really did.
No she didn't.
What am I going to do now? I can't live without Susan. I gotta get her back. How? How, am I gonna get her back?
[OC] Not only didn't you love her, you didn't even like her.
Who says?
You did.
Ah, ...A beautiful successful intelligent woman's in love with me and I throw it all away. uh oh boy. Now I'll spend the rest of my life living alone. I'll sit in my disgusting little apartment watching basketball games, eating Chinese take out. Walking around with no underwear. Because I'm too lazy to do a laundry.
You walk around with no underwear?
Yeah, what do you do when you run out of laundry?
I do a wash.
Who am I going to meet who is better than her? No one, Jerry. No one's better than her.
When you were with her you said you couldn't stand her.
I loved her!
You said goin up the steps of her apartment was like being taken to a cell.
I would give anything to be going up those stairs again.
I gotta call her. Should I call her?
George, I don't know if that is such a good idea?
Whyie?
You need some professional advice. Why don't you go see Elaine's friend? She's a therapist.
I'm not going to see that nut doctor she went to Europe with.
No, no no [Elaine enters, flossing teeth] Elaine what's the name of that friend of yours ... that's a therapist ... the woman.
Dana Folley.
Right, Dana Folley.
She any good?
Yeah, she's terrific. Why? You thinking of going?
Wa, uh, ...
Tia? Who's that?
She's the model I met on the plane.
She sent you a Christmas card?
Um uh. And we're going out Saturday night.
My Darling Susan! My DARLING!!!
What are you doing?
... date with Fred.
The religious guy?
He's not THAT religious.
Let us pray.
Hey, you got any Double Crunch?
Yeah.
Kramer, should I call Susan?
Now what does the little man inside you say? See you gotta listen to the little man.
My little man doesn't know.
The little man knows all.
My little man's an idiot.
See, she was clever. You know she put her picture on a card. I should do that. I never do anything like that.
You want a picture like that on a Christmas card? I can do that for you. ...
She kept such a nice clean apartment. She was so sanitary.
No, no, I was just thinking out loud I don't want my picture on a card.
No, no, I'll take your picture. I'll take care of everything.
She made a big breakfast every Sunday. I don't know what she put in those eggs.
All right, ... now, you come on over. I'll have my cereal and I'll take your picture.
Really? Can you really take a picture?
Yeah, he's good. He takes good pictures. He's got equipment over there.
All right, ha ha
I don't know about that outfit though.
Why? What's wrong with it?
Well, we'll have to improvise.
(singing) Oh hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl who walked out on me. Tell her I'm sorry. Tell her I need my baby ... oh won't you tell her ... I love her. Oh hey, ...
George I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
So, I'm thinking of putting in na tropical fish tank right here.
Are you sure you're ready for that kind of comitment?
Well, I figure if it doesn't work out I can always flush them down the toilet.
That's horrible!
What's that perfume you're wearing?
oh I completely forgot I want you to see this. The CALVIN KLEIN ad I was telling you about came out today.
What is that smell?
It's here somewhere.
It smells like the beach.
Exactly.
Oh my God is that the new perfume?
Yeah.
I can't believe this. My next door neighbour had the idea for this exact perfume last year. He even met with an executive at CALVIN KLEIN. I can't believe they stole his idea.
Are you sure?
And you're the model for this perfume?
Uh, that's him. He just came home. ... Uh, the door [Jerry pushes his door against Kramer's entrance]
Hey
Hey.
Hey, how ya' doing? [Trying to enter]
Yeah, uh, I'll see you later.
I just wanted to borrow your Dust Buster.
All right come on in. ... Just wait over HERE! Just wait here and I'll get it for you. ... Kramer this is Tia.
Hello.
How tall are you?
Five ten.
Come on lets see - Back to Back.
NO! Kramer!
What's the matter with you? I just wanted to see how tall she was.
Oh, you're tall - she's tall I'm tall. What's the difference who's tall. We're all tall.
What's that?
What?
That smell. What's that smell?
(starting the Dust Buster) What smell?
It's very familiar. I can't put my finger on it. It's very familiar.
Oh, they're all the same. Here. [gives him Dust Buster] Now if you'll excuse us, ..
Yeah, okay, So I'll see you tomorrow uh?
Okay.
Yeah. Nice meeting you.
Nice meeting you too.
I'll see you later.
Ooow, that was close.
[OC] THE BEACH!!!
You smell like the beach. What's the name of that perfume? you're wearing.
It's Ocean by CALVIN KLEIN.
CALVIN KLEIN? No, no. That's my idea. They, they stole my idea. Y' see I had the idea of a cologne that makes you smell like you just came from the beach.
I know look at this [shows ad]
Whooo, ... That's you! What is going on here? The gyp(?) he laughs at me then he steals my idea. I could have been a millionaire. I could have been a fragrance millionaire, Jerry. ... They're not going to get away with this.
Hello. George, come in. Come in I've heard an awful lot about you. Please sit down.
Well hello. Um, ah, specifically the reason that I'm here, uh, I don't know uh what Elaine told you but uh I broke up with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago. Actually she broke up with me [struggling with his coat zipper] and uh, well, I was the cause of it and uh, I just wanted to find out from you ... What's with this thing?
So uh, she broke up with you? ...
Yeah, and, ... Why won't this go down?
It's all right don't worry about it. So, why did she break up with you?
What is with this damn zipper?
It doesn't matter. You'll fix it later. Tell me about your girlfriend.
It's stuck on a piece of cloth here. I can't get the cloth out.
It doesn't matter, so ...
This is a brand new jacket. Boy this really burns me up, ...
George, George, look at me. Okay, forget about the zipper. ... What's your girlfriend's name?
... Susan.
Okay, we're getting somewhere.
UH, ha ha, ... It's just SO frustrating. It's a brand new jacket.
Anyway so Fred and I are going to do some volunteer work for that Church on Amsterdam.
Oh, volunteer work!. See that's what I like about the holiday season. That's the true spirit of Christmas. People being helped by people other than me. That makes me feel good inside. Look at what we have here. (mail). A Christmas card from Laine. You didn't have to go to all that trouble.
It was no trouble. My assistant did the whole thing.
I didn't even see the picture. How did it come out?
Well, you know. It's a picture?
Oh yeah. Look at that. Looks good. Kramer did a good job.
Yeah, well. How hard is it to take a picture?
... um ...
What?
Did you look at look at this picture carefully?
Carefully?
Because I'm not sure and and and correct me if I'm wrong but I think I see ... a nipple.
What?
Here. Take a look. What, what is that?
(gasps) Oh my God! That's my nipple.
That's what I thought.
That's my nipple. My nipple's exposed. I sent this card to hundreds of people! My parents. My boss. Uh, Nana and Papa.
DIDN'T YOU LOOK AT THE PICTURE?
Oh God I didn't notice. Oh, what am I going to do? You know your whole life you go through painstaking efforts to hide your nipple and then BOOM, suddenly hundreds of people get their own personal shot of it.
Hey!
Have you seen the card?
What card?
This car.
Yeah, yeah. Of course. I took it.
Well did you notice anything unusual about it?
No.
Well come here and take a look.
Yeah, so?
So, what's that?
That's a nipple.
Right!!
Ooo!
Aw, great!? Didn't you see that?
Aw, no, no I didn't notice it. no, uh,
It's because you made me wear that stupid shirt.
Well, maybe no one noticed it. You didn't notice it. Let me go get Newman. We'll see if he sees it.
No. I don't want him looking.
Oh what's the difference. Everybody else you know has it.
Oh my God. I sent one to the super in my building. My mailman. My ten year old little nephew. Sister Mary Catherine. Father Chelios. Oh my God Fred! I sent one to Fred.
Okay. What is it?
Take a look at this card. Tell me if you notice anything unusual about it.
Your nipple's showing.
Okay. Thanks.
Anything else?
No.
All right. See you later.
What? So what? It's a nipple. A little round circular protuberance. What's the big deal? See everybody's got them. See I got them.
I got them too.
Everybody's got them.
You see it's kind of got a little piece of cloth that's slipped underneath and it's ...
Pull it up a little bit.
Uhg. Well you hold it. Wait, uh, Damn It! I can't move it. God, I've never seen a zipper so stubborn. DAMN IT! I almost had it.
Yeah, okey, wait wait. That will separate.
No. Let me try...
Take it right off the chest...
Ugh, ..
You're gonna rip it. You're gonna rip it.
YEAH!! UGH!!! ARG!!! ... I am afraid we're going to have to stop.
Okay. Uh, my mother is is going to pay for the sessions. ... Oh,Elaine?
Yeah.
(stares at card)
No, No, No, No, Oh, No.
Well every day for the past four days she hasn't returned one call.
Was it a scratch or a pick?
It was a scratch.
Hey. It's me.
Don't you think I know the difference between a pick and a scratch?
Yeah?
(OC) It's me.
Come on up.
Was there any nostril penetration?
There may have been some incidental penetration. But from her angle she was in no position to make the call.
So let's say in her mind she witnessed a pick. Okay, so then what?
Is that so unforgivable? Is that like breaking a commandment? Did God say to Moses thou shalt not pick?
I guarantee you that Moses was a picker. You wander throughh the desert for forty years with that dry air. ... You telling me you're not going to have occasion to clean house a little bit.
Let me ask you something. If you were going out with somebody and if she did that what would, would you do? Would you continue going out with her?
No. That's disgusting!
You cannot believe what I'm going through. That card is plastered all over the office. Everybody is calling me, Nip! ... Yeah. That's my new nickname at the office. Nip! These guys keep asking me out for drinks. Not only that, Fred, you know the guy I told you about? He hasn't called me in three days. ... [sees card] Oh please!
Hey. How come I didn't get a Christmas card? Everybody else got one. Jerry got one, Kramer got one. I thought we were good friends. I don't get a Christmas card. I don't get it.
You want a Christmas card? You want a Christmas card? All right here. [rubs George's head on her breasts] Here's your Christmas card.
Got any Double Crunch?
yeah. I think I do.
What's that perfume?
What, Ocean.
That's mine. That's my smell. Jerry you've got to get that model to get me an appointment with CALVIN KLEIN.
I can't She won't return my calls because she caught me in a pick at a light.
I thought you said it was a scratch.
But that's not what she thinks.
Why don't you call her agency. Maybe she's been out of town and she didn't get the calls.
All right. I'll call the agency. [Elaine grabs card from George] Hello. Yes, I'm trying to get in touch with Tia Van Camp. Do you know if she's been in town? She's been in town. Oh really. well thank you very much. [hangs up] She has been in town. She's at CALVIN KLEIN's right now.
Let's go.
It'll be different this time.
I need someone a little more stable.
I'm not stable? I'm like a rock. I take these glasses off, you can't tell the difference between me and a rock. I put these glasses on a rock. You know what jumps into most people's minds? Costanza!
People don't change.
I change I change. Two weeks ago I tried a soft boiled egg. Never liked it before. Now I'm dunkin a piece of toast in there and I'm loving it.
I'm not a soft boiled egg.
And I am not a piece of toast.
I just don't think we have anything in common.
That's okay. That's good. You think Louie Pasteur and his wife had anything in common? He was in the fields all day with the cows, you know with the milk, examining the milk, delving into milk, consummed with milk. Pasteurization, Homogenization, She was in the kitchen killing cockroaches with a boot on each hand.
Why were there so many cockroaches?
Because. There was a lot of cake lying around the house. Just sitting there going with all the excess milk from all the experiments [grins]
And they got along?
Yes! Yes. You know. She didn't know about Pasteurization. He didn't know anout Fumigation. But they made it work!
I want to talk to Calvin.
You can't go in there.
Let me talk to Calvin.
Kramer?
Yeah, uh.
Who are you?
I'm here to talk about the ocean.
Oh, yes kramer. I uh, think I know something about this. Will you excuse us Tia? [Tia leaves]
Now I don't want any trouble Calvin.
Neither do I.
Hello there you are.
What are you doing here?
Well, I had to talk to you - I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.
Well, I've been busy.
Because I - I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me (flustered, he indicates a nose pick)
(Waving him off) I'd rather not talk about this..
But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.
I know what I saw. (Turns toward the elevators)
But there - but there was no pick! I - I did not pick! There ws no piick!
I gotta go. (Quickly walks away from Jerry)
No! No pick!
Calvin Klein's office]
All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies..
(Reflecting on Kramer) Interesting face..
Yeah.. And, um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know, he - he laughed at me.
You're very lithe, aren't you? Very graceful.
Well, yeah.
Sit down, eh? (Kramer, misjudging one side of the couch, sits down uncomfortably) You're very lean, but muscular..
You know, I try to take care of myself. I - I watch what I eat. Ah, just recently I cut out fructose.
You're spectacular.
(Flattered) Oh?
Elaine's office]
I told you, Fred - my friend's next door neighbor took it.
(Incredulous) Soo - what happened?!
Well, I-I-I must a missed a button. I forgot to button it.
I really don't see how you could miss a button like that.
Oh, you've never missed a button?! (Phone rings, she puts it on speakerphone) Yeah?..
Your sister, Gail.
Oh, God - my nephew. (Picks up the phone and hits the button) Hi, Gail!.. Yu.. yu... Yes, Gail, I know how old he is.
(Pokes his head into the doorway) Hey, Nip, ya need that manuscript or can I take it home?
Yeah, take it! Take it!.. An' stop calling me "Nip"! (Co-worker takes it and quickly leaves. Elaine goes back to the phone) It was an accident! Well.. well.. it's gotta be somewhere. Look under his mattress.
Susan's apartment building]
Calvin Klein's office]
About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point? (She sees Kramer emerge from another room. He's wearing only dress shoes, socks, and his briefs) My.. he's sexual, athletic.. an' without a trace of self-consciousness!
His buttocks are sublime!
Of course, his pectorals could use a little work - I suppose we could get him into the weight room.
(Mesmerized with Kramer's body) No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately.
You've done it again, C.K.!
Calvin Klein office building]
An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing, and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught. (Elevator doors open) Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame and humiliation because of people like you.. (Everyone but Jerry is now in the elevator. Jerry's still addressing them) Are we not human?! If we pick, do we not bleed?! (Elevator doors shut. A few people in the hallway are looking at him, he turns and addresses them) I am not an animal!
Elaine's office]
I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you, I wish now that I had! (Fred, shocked by her speech, flees. She calls after him, still standing at the hallway) Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!
So the minute I started up the steps to her apartment I knew I made a terrible mistake. Going back with her. So we're in her apartment she goes into the bathroom. I'm cursing myself; now how do I get out of this? Then it hits me like a bolt of lightening. The pick.
The pick?
The pick?
She comes out of the bathroom, I'm in up to my wrist. You should have seen the look on her face.
I think I've seen that look.
I've got the magazine. The underwear ad came out.
Boy, they really worked on your pectorals.
Your buttocks are spectacular.
Oh my!
What?
I'm not sure but... I think I see your...
The show has been delayed.
You don't understand. I got this all timed out. I got another spot across town at 950, I'm not gonna be able to make it!
I hear you, guy.
And I'm doin' Letterman Monday. You know, I gotta work out the material!
Buckles. The manager assures Jerry that Buckles isn't on the menu. He just hangs around hoping that somebody drops out.
Why don't you come back and do the 11 o'clock spot?
No, I'm supposed to meet my friends to see this movie ``CheckMate'' at 1030.
Hey, Jer!
[not losing a step] Heeeeyyyyyyyy..... [and out the door]
Excuse me, do you have a ticket?
No.
Okay. Good.
When Jerry shows up at the other comedy place, the manager tells him his spot was for 915, not 950. The manager had no choice but to give Jerry's spot to...
Jerry!
What are <you> doing here?
Hey, do you think this is funny? ``Why do they call it athlete's foot? You don't have to be an athlete to get it. I mean, my father gets it all the time, and believe me, he's no athlete!''
I've been *dying* to see ``CheckMate''.
Well, if it's as good as ``Ponce de Leon'', I'll be happy.
``Ponce de Leon'', are you kidding me? I hated that movie!
``Ponce de Leon''? But that was great!
Oh, <come on>. That Fountain of Youth scene at the end, where they're all splashin' around, and then they go running over to the mirror to see if it really worked? I mean, come on! [laughing too hard to continue] That's stupid!
Lemme tell you sum'in. When Ponce looked in that mirror and saw that he hadn't changed, and that tear started to roll down his cheek? ... I lost it.
Kramer joins George and Elaine after looking for them at the Paradise Twin around the corner. Elaine hates the Paradise because it's a multiplex; she'd rather see a movie on a big screen. Something catches Kramer's eye.
Listen, I'm gonna get a hot dog at Payapa King.
No, wait!
You're not going to get back here in time!
I'm starvin', I haven't had any dinner!
You can get a hot dog in the theater.
I don't wanna get a movie hot dog! [in tears] I want a Papaya King hot dog!
Kramer, Jerry is going to be here any second, and then this line is going to start moving, and we're going to end up in the front row.
Well, just save me a seat.
No! I don't want to save seats. Don't put me through that! I once had the fleece just ripped out of my winter coat in a seat-saving incident!
I'm in line to buy.
No, George, this is the ticket-<holders> line.
No it's not, it's the ticket-<buyers> line.
Then how come we're not moving?
Good question.
Is this the ticket holders line, or the buyers?
Holders.
But I asked you before if you had a ticket, and you said no!
I didn't. My friend was getting it.
[furious] Good. It's good to be accurate like that.
Can you believe him?
He's spaced out.
How long would *you* have stood in the ticket-holders line?
[thinks for a while]
[gives up] Yeah, exactly...
20, and Kramer suggests they go watch the 1045 showing of "CheckMate" at the Paradise. Elaine enters whine mode.
I don't wanna go to a... miniplex multi-theater!
It's the same movie! What's the difference?
It's not a theater, it's like a room where they bring in POWs to show them propaganda films.
[to taxi driver] Take the Park!
No no no, take 55th.
Jerry, I want you to do me a favor. No more fish!
[rubbing his eyes hoping the nightmare will end] Okay, I get your point!
I had a point?
Hey, you know what else is playing here? ``Rochelle Rochelle''.
Sigh/Ugh.
I wouldn't mind seein' <that>.
Yeah. You know, men can sit through the most boring movie if there's even the slightest possibility that a woman will take her top off.
So what's your point?
By the way, you owe me seven fifty.
Oh, all right. Can you break a twenty?
No, I don't have any change.
Oh, well, then I'll pay you later.
Or, I could take the twenty, then I could pay *you* later.
Yeah, you *could*...
Might be easier.
I mean, how is that easier? I mean, then you would owe me twelve fifty instead of me owing you seven fifty.
[trying to act as if he doesn't care one way or the other, but we know better] Either way.
Yeah.
So... Can I have it?
I tell you what, I'll get the popcorn and the soda.
Whaddya mean, you'll ``get'' the popcorn and the soda?
I will buy your popcorn and soda. We'll call it even.
I tell you what, you give me the twenty, and I will buy *you* a popcorn and soda, and I'll throw in a bon-bons.
[exasperated] George, you're sappin' my strength.
You go in and save seats.
[in a panic] Me!? But that's three seats! I can't save three seats! I told you about that guy who tore up my winter coat!
Jerry, I want you to have this piece of material.
That's very nice of you, but I can't do the voices.
Jerry! Don't start up with me!
I gotta get out of this cab...
But Jerry, quit riffing!
No, I'm not riffing. I'm ignoring! Do you understand the difference?
[pause] Can you help me get on The Tonight Show?
No, these are saved.
All of them? C'mon, you can't take *four* seats.
What, is that a rule?
Well, why don't *you* go, and I could save the seats. You said you didn't like saving anyway.
[stopping someone from sitting in the seat next to her] No, *TAKEN*, Taken, taken. [to George] [shrugs] I'm getting the hang of it.
Why don't you give me the twenty, and I'll stop and get change, and then you and I can... uh... you-know, settle.
Can we do this later, George?
Psh. What's the point of even discussing it? [condescendingly takes her hand and pats it] You'll give me the money when you have it. [takes two steps, then reconsiders, then re-reconsiders] I, I trust you.
Could you do me a favor? If you see a guy that's five foot eleven, he's got uh a big head and flared nostrils, tell him his friend's going to be right back, okay?
No, I'm sorry, these are taken. ... They're in the lobby buying popcorn. ... What are you doing? These are taken, these are taken!
Which one?
These two and this one. ... No! Don't come over here! These are taken. Go! Go! These are taken! They're taken! THEY'RE TAKEN!!!
Oh, take 'em.
Um, excuse me, have you see a guy with like a horse face, big teeth, and a, and a pointed nose?
... flared nostrils?
Yeah.
Nope, haven't seen him.
Jerry, could you do me a personal favor? And if I'm out of line, *please*, let me know. Could I keep my trench coat in your closet for a few months?
Your trench coat in my closet?
Jerry, my closet is packed to the gills, I'm afraid to open the door. Just for a few months. It'll make all the difference in the world.
We should see ``Rochelle Rochelle''. I hear it's really hot.
No thanks, maybe some other time.
Really? Do you really mean that?
No, I don't.
You liked the athlete's foot bit, right?
No. No. I was kidding. It's terrible.
Hi, I got some friends inside, I gotta get a message to 'em. Mind if I walk through real quick?
[indicates ``okay'']
Hey, did that guy show up?
The guy with the... horse face... and the big teeth...
No, the guy with the big head and the flared nostrils.
Haven't seen him. There was a short guy with glasses... Looked like Humpty-Dumpty with a melon hat. But he left.
So I got home, and he was vacuuming! I mean, he's twelve years old! Who else but my Alan would do something like that?
And then last night, he put on my high heels. Oh, he put on such a show for us! He was dancing around, lip-sync'ing to ``A Chorus Line'', I mean you can see he's got talent.
[annoyed] Excuse me, excuse me.
What's the problem?
[momentarily shocked, as if the answer were self-evident] You're talking.
It's the ``Coming Attractions''.
So anyway, he sings, he dances. And do you know what he's gotten into now? He is cooking! He does a crepe...
Ticket, sir?
Uh, I just went out, I went to look for my friend?
Do you have your stub?
[as if the word were totally foreign] My `stub'?
Mm hm.
You don't remember me?
It's a big city, sir.
I went in with a pretty woman? You know, kinda short, big wall o' hair, face like a frying pan?
[whispering] Elaine? [loud whisper] Elaine! [louder whisper] Elaine!
[quite out loud, not even pretending to whisper] Elaine!
The Village Voice calls it a masterpiece. A young woman's strange, erotic journey from Milan to Minsk.
It's a story about life. And love. And becoming a woman. ``Rochelle Rochelle'', now playing at Paradise 2.
Uh, could I have a medium Diet Coke?
Do you want the Medium size or the middle size?
What's the difference?
Well, we have three sizes. Medium, Large, and Jumbo.
[momentarily perplexed] What happened to the small?
There is no small. Small is Medium.
What's... medium?
Medium is Large, and large is Jumbo.
Oh-kay. Gimme the large.
That's medium.
Right. Yeah. [fearing the answer] Could I have a small popcorn?
There is no small. [flash of perky inspiration] Child-size is small.
What's `medium'?
Adult.
Do adults ever order the child-size?
[chuckling] Not usually.
[laughs appreciably] Okay, gimme the `adult'.
Do you want butter?
Is it *real* butter?
[perkily] It's butter-*flavored*!
[exasperated] What is it made of?
[perkily] It's yellow!
44th and 9th.
Have you got a cigarette?
No.
Ticket, sir?
We've just been through this! You don't remember? We just had this exact same conversation a minute ago!
I need to see your stub.
[realizing the only way out is to show the stub] I've got the stub.
There you go, okay? That's my *other* friend's ticket. You happy now? You got two tickets.
Ticket, sir?
Uh, no, see, my friend already bought me a ticket. I'm late, and she's inside.
Go ahead.
Is that seat taken?
It's all yours.
I'm very sorry, you give me few minutes. I have to stop for gasoline.
Gasoline? Can't you get it after you drop me off?
[taken aback] No! Impossible! It is on `Empty'!
You're soaking wet. Who are you?
My name is Rochelle, I'm from Milan. I'm supposed to visit my relatives in Minsk.
Here, stand by the fire. Take off those wet clothes, you'll catch cold.
Oh, my hand's so cold, I can barely get these buttons open.
Oh, that's much better. Much...
I just went to get popcorn... Ugh... [shakes more popcorn] I just went to get popcorn, okay? And and and somebody took my seat, and my coat is in there!
There's a seat in the front row.
No no, I can't sit in the front row.
Well, you're going to have to wait, then.
I can't stand around here for *two hours*!
I could let you see ``Rochelle Rochelle''.
[heavy sarcasm] Oh. Thanks.
Oh, hey, listen, by the way, have you seen a tall... lanky... doofus, with a, with a bird-face and hair like the Bride of Frankenstein?
Haven't seen him.
He's sitting on a coat.
Hey, did I make it?
Sorry.
Oh, great. That's great. What a night.
Pat Buckles, ladies and gentlemen. Another round of applause for Pat Buckles!
You got my spot?
That athlete's foot bit killed!
Really...
Do you think I need to lose some weight?
Weight? Naw. Just need some more height.
My whole night's ruined. I didn't do any sets, didn't do any movies...
Come on, we can still catch most of ``Rochelle Rochelle''.
``Rochelle Rochelle'', huh?
A young girl's strange, erotic journey from Milan to Minsk.
[his interest piqued] Minsk?
Oh, gimme a break!
Elaine?
Jerry!
Elaine!
[whispered] Shut up.
Jerry?
George?
Elaine?
George! [waves hi]
Hey, where's Kramer?
[whispered] Will you shut up?
I don't know. Does this movie stink or what!
Let's get outta here. [to Buckles] I'll see ya.
You're leaving?
Yeah.
[holding out his coat] Jerry, take the coat. Please. One month.
I don't want the coat.
Jerry! Call me when you get home so I know you're okay!
[studying his jacket] Oh man! Look at this! I sat in gum. Oh, by the way, you owe me seven fifty.
I didn't even use the ticket!
I still paid for it!
I only have a twenty.
That's my coat! Gimme that. Where did you get that?
It was on the seat...
*YOU* took my seat!?
You uh owe me for the ticket.
Yeah, right...
What is that stain [on my coat]?
It's yellow mustard. [To George] Can you break a twenty?
``Oh, you mean that was the same guy from the <beginning>... Ohhhhhhhhhh...'' Nobody will explain it to you. When you're in the theater, you can't find out. [whispering to imaginary friends seated around him] ``Why did they kill that guy?... Why did they kill him?... Who was that guy? What was the... I thought he was with them? Wasn't he with them? Why would they kill him if he was with them? Oh, he wasn't *really* with them.... I thought he was with them. It's a good thing they killed him.''
So you're a lawyer. What kind of cases do you handle?
Oh, everything. Divorce, patents, immigration and naturalization.
What is that, immigrants come over, you show them how to act natural?
No, they're not funny at all. No, I have no funny friends. I'm the funny one. El Clowno.
Look, I was nice enough to pick it up for you
Hey, I've been back four days, I want my mail.
It's mostly bills, magazines and junk mail anyway.
Elaine, that's what mail is. Without bills, magazines and junk mail, there is no mail.
Here's my card.
Oh, ok. Thank you. It was good talking to you.
Nice meeting you.
Yeah.
Hi!
Hey, how ya doin?
You would not believe what just happened. I was waiting for you and this woman was sitting at the counter.
What, the one who just left?
Yeah, yeah, and we started talking, and she's this lawyer who's incredible! Everything I said was funny! You know, she laughed at everything I said, she thinks I'm hilarious. You know in a way, it was almost too good. I started so good, I can't go any place but down now, ya know? I got no place to go.
Yeah, well, I guess it's all over.
(looking behind the counter) Hey, is that Babu? It is! (walking over) Hey, Babu!
Jerry!
Look at you, you got the job.
Yes, yes, they give me job thanks to you.
Oh, I didn't do anything.
Yes, you do everything, get me job, you get me a place to live in your building.
Come on.
You very very good man, you do everything for me. My family and I can never thank you enough for everything you do.
You see, this is what I do with women. I start out too strong, now I have to become real, that's when it all falls apart. What good is real? They don't want real, they want funny.
No they don't.
Ooooh, yes they do.
Nooo.
Ya gotta put on a show, ya always gotta give them a big show. You always have to be 'on' otherwise why would they like me? They'd just go for a better looking guy with more money.
You mean that's true, I'm right?!
Ok, great, well, I'm glad everything worked out, Babu.
Oh, yes, yes, everything wonderful.
Ok, I'll see you around the building.
I'll see you *in* the building.
(returning to the table) Remember Babu Bhatt?
Who's he?
Remember that guy who opened the restaurant across the street from the building last year and he wasn't doing so well and I told him he should make it into all Pakistani and that drove him right out of business? So, you uh, going with me to the auto show with me Saturday?
Yeah, yeah.
Can you bring my mail then?
What mail?
I picked up his mail while he was on the road
Why didn't Kramer pick it up?
Cause he's at that baseball fantasy camp in Florida.
Oh yeah, right. When's he coming back?
Monday, I think.
Kramer goes to a fantasy camp. His whole life is a fantasy camp. People should plunk down two-thousand dollars to live like him for a week. Do nothing, fall ass-backwards into money, mooch food off your neighbors and have sex without dating; that's a fantasy camp.
Hey listen, if you're gonna go out with this lawyer, why don't you have dinner with us and then maybe you can go to the auto show with her if you want, you know, have a little company, take the pressure off.
...he never heard of corduroy!
(howling with laughter) Stop it, you're killing me!!
He never heard of corduroy! True story, true story.
No, no I don't think so.
Why?
Well I think I'm better off going one-on-one.
I don't know why you want to play man-to-man when you could play a zone.
She might not be comfortable.
Why? We're all very nice, we're very friendly.
We'll be funny.
No! No. It's not good, I don't think so.
Alright, well if you change your mind, we'll wind up as Isabella's probably around seven.
No, no Isabella's, I don't want to go to Isabella's.
Why?
No, it's too trendy, no Isabella's.
(tasting the wine) Excellent. Like I really know what I'm talking about.
Toasting makes me uncomfortable. But toast, I love. Never start the day without a good piece of toast. In fact, let's toast to toast.
Look who's here! Georgie-boy!
What are you doing here? I thought you said you hated Isabella's?
No, I talked him into it.
What happened to the auto show?
Oh, we're still going, we're still going. Elaine, do the spokes model.
The turbo quadramatic transmission offers you the power and prestige to propel you well into the 21st century.
Cheryl, Elaine, and uh, Jerry.
Would you like to join us?
Oh no no no, they don't want to join us.
Oh no, it's ok, don't be silly.
Ok, well why don't we just put these two tables together?
(as the others are repositioning the tables) No, no, you can't do that, they're round, it makes an 'eight' and, yeah, well alright.
Jerry? Jerry, tell them that funny story you were telling me--
No! No.
No George, it's so funny. We saw this cab driver's picture, right?
(interrupting) You know we should really order, the service is so slow here, by the time you get anything...
Oh, Cheryl, can I ask you a legal question? Um, I'm being sued.
Oh? What happened?
Well, I ran out to apologize to a virgin and I crossed against the light and I knocked over the delivery boy.
Was he Chinese?
Yeah.
Is your last name Benes?
How did you know?
Ping is my cousin!
No!
That's so funny!
I'm handling his case!
What? You're Cheryl Fong?
That's right!
Oh my god, I can't believe it! That is such a coincidence!
Yeah, I know!
Wow, well, I guess you don't have any advice for me on how to win the case?
Will you excuse me? I have to make a call.
Tell Ping I said hello.
Tell him you think you may have broken the case wide open.
What?
This is not good. This is not good.
What's the matter?
I just don't think it's such a great idea for you to sit here.
Why not?
He thinks that if you're too funny, he might not look so funny.
Biff?
What?
You're not worried about that?
No, of course not.
I mean, so what if I'm funny? Who cares?
He thinks that if a woman sees a guy put on a better show, she'll walk out on his show, go see the other show.
Well, should we leave?
Maybe you don't have to be so funny. I mean, would it kill you not to be so funny all the time? That's all I'm asking. This woman thinks I'm very funny. Now you're gonna be funny, so what am I gonna be? I'm gonna be a short bald guy with glasses who suddenly doesn't seem so funny.
This is so ridiculous. Can we just go over there?
I don't have to be funny, I don't care.
You don't?
No way! It's completely under my control.
No, it's not. You cannot not be funny.
Of course I can, am I being funny now?
A little.
Oh, this is funny? I'm being funny?
Yeah.
George, is this funny?
It's funny! (To Elaine) and it wouldn't kill you to not be so funny either.
What? What did I do?
Hi.
(subdued, almost somber) Hello. Welcome back.
Sorry, it was my aunt's birthday and she makes such a big deal about it.
Well, nobody likes to get old, right?
Well, birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year has gone by and how little we've grown. No matter how desperate we are that someday a better self will emerge, with each flicker of the candles on the cake, we know it's not to be, that for the rest of our sad, wretched pathetic lives, this is who we are to the bitter end. Inevitably, irrevocably; happy birthday? No such thing.
Funny guy, huh?
Here, take it. I was glad to get rid of it.
Well thank you very much, it's about time.
Oh listen, guess what? Cheryl convinced Ping to drop the case against me.
Drop the case? Well, congratulations, that'll save you some money.
Yeah, no kidding. That lawyer was gonna charge me a fortune.
(leafing through his mail) Oh great, a birth announcement from Arnie and Joy Harris.
Hear that? Guess who's back. (Opening the door) Hey!
Hey.
I thought you weren't coming back till Monday.
Well, the camp ended a few days early.
Why?
Uh, well there was an incident.
What happened?
I punched Mickey Mantle in the mouth.
What?
Yeah, I punched him and they took him to the hospital and then they canceled the rest of the week.
You punched who in the mouth?
Mickey Mantle.
What happened?
Well, you know, we were playing a game and, you know, I was pitching, and I was really throwing some smoke. And Joe Pepitone, he was up, and man that guy, you know, he was crowding the plate.
Wow! Joe Pepitone!
Yeah, well, Joe Pepitone or not, I own the inside of that plate. So I throw one, you know, inside, you know, a little chin music, put him right on his pants. Cause I gotta intimidate when I'm on the mound. Well the next pitch, he's right back in the same place. So, I had to plunk him.
You plunked him.
Oh yeah. Well, he throws down his bat, he comes racing up to the mound. Next thing, both benches are cleared, you know? A brouhaha breaks out between the guys in the camp, you know, and the old Yankee players, and as I'm trying to get Moose Skowron off of one of my teammates, you know, somebody pulls me from behind, you know, and I turned around and I popped him. I looked down, and woah man, it's Mickey. I punched his lights out.
Wow, this is incredible!
Leave me alone! You can't do this to me!
What's going on out there?
What are you doing? This is not right, people. You're making a very bad mistake, very bad.
Babu? (leaving) I'll be right back.
(to Kramer) Yeah, so?
Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's screaming, "Mickey! Mickey! What have you done with Mickey? You killed Mickey!"
So what'd you do?
Well, I got the hell out of there.
They took Babu away?!
Yeah, the Immigration guy said his Visa was expired. Poor Babu, everything was going so well for him. He had an apartment, he had a job. What a shame.
I will, Babu! I will help you, Babu, don't worry!
Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's chasing me around, he trips over third base and knocks over Clete Boyer.
(thumbing through his mail) Uh oh.
What?
Well this is interesting.
What is it?
It's a letter from the Immigration Bureau, it's Babu's Visa renewal application form. They must have put it in my mailbox by mistake.
Well, doesn't he need that?
If you had given me my mail last week when I got home, this whole thing never would have happened.
Well, you should have come to my house to pick it up.
Yeah, so am I being funny now?
No, actually, you're not being funny now.
See, I told you I wasn't funny all the time. (George enters) Hey George, look, I'm not funny now.
No, and you weren't funny last night either. In fact, you got us both so depressed, she asked me to drive her home after dinner.
Oh look, I need to get in touch with Cheryl. Babu needs a lawyer, his Visa's expired.
What do you need her for? There's a million lawyers.
Yeah, but you said this is one of the things that her firm does.
Alright, alright, but no funny business, same deal as last night.
Ah, will you stop it already?
Jerry, please?
How long is this gonna go on?
Till I'm comfortable.
Well, when is that gonna be?
After consummation.
Consummation? I don't think you have enough material.
I actually have a friend in the Immigration Department who owes me a big favor. You're very lucky.
(somber) That's wonderful news. Thank you.
You're a very serious person, aren't you?
Well, with so many people in the world deprived and unhappy, it doesn't seem like it would be fair to be cheerful.
I understand.
I think it's curdled.
I don't care.
Do you ever laugh?
Not really. Sometimes, when I'm in the tub.
That's so sad. What do you do?
I'm a comedian. Oh, let me get that. (reaching for the check) You've been so helpful.
(entering as Jerry heads to the register) Hey, we're gonna go see Babu now, right?
Yeah, I'll just pay for this.
Oh, I'm just gonna go say hi to Cheryl. (walking over to the booth) Hi.
Hi.
Listen, gosh, I wanted to thank you so much for convincing Ping to drop the case.
Well, after we met, you were all so nice. I just couldn't go through with it. But between you and me, you would have paid through the nose.
Babu!
Jerry! Jerry, hello Jerry!
You remember Elaine.
Yes, yes of course!
Nice to meet you.
So nice of you both to come.
Oh, Babu.
No no, you're both very kind, very kind.
We try.
We do what we can.
We do what we can.
The problem is I never got my Visa renewal form in the mail. I was expecting it.
Yes, well, see, here's the thing, Babu. Um, what happened was I was away for a couple of weeks doing some comedy shows.
Comedy shows! You're a very funny man.
Well, Elaine here was picking up my mail while I was away, because you know that little box can get very full.
Oh yes, of course. TV Guide, magazines, everything. You know, I would have picked up your mail, your box is right next to mine.
Oh, I don't want to bother you.
No bother! You get me job, you get me apartment, you very very good man.
So yesterday, after they took you away, I looked in my mail and I noticed that the mailman accidentally put your Visa renewal in my mail box.
Come again?
You see, I've been home for a week and Elaine didn't give me my mail until yesterday, even though I asked her repeatedly for it.
Yeah, but Babu, he could have come to my house to pick it up.
You had my Visa application?!
Well not technically.
(extremely and suddenly agitated) I kill you!!
Well what about her?
I kill both of you!!
Babu?!
No Babu! No Babu! You bad man! You very bad man! You very lazy bad man!
Babu, I'm gonna fix everything! I have a lawyer who knows someone in the Immigration Department, they're gonna straighten the whole thing out, the wheels are in motion, things are happening even as we speak!
The wheels are in motion?
The wheels are in motion, things are happening!
Jerry?
I'm very attracted to him.
You think the person you were talking to is him? That's not even close to him. He's funny, Jerry's funny.
He never said anything funny.
He can't not be funny.
No no no, he's dark. And disturbed.
Dark and disturbed? His whole life revolves around Superman and cereal. I convinced him to act like that so that you would think I was funnier. That's how disturbed I am! If you want disturbed, that's disturbed. You can't find sickness like that anywhere, you think sickness like that grows on trees? Nobody is sicker than me, nobody. He's pretending, I'm the genuine article.
So you're telling me Jerry's whole thing was an act?
Yes! And I put him up to it, because I'm sick! I'm the one that needs help.
I gotta go.
Well, should I call you later?
Please don't.
But, but I'm disturbed! I'm depressed! I'm inadequate! I got it all!!
So, what's up with Babu? How come he's not back?
I don't know, I don't understand it. Cheryl was supposed to take care
It's George.
C'mon up.
Babu must be back.
Babu, my goodness, what has happened to you?
Where's Babu?
He is in Pakistan!
Who are you?
I am his brother. He knew a lawyer, it was all going to be fixed.
I'm sure the lawyer did everything they could.
Then where is Babu? What happened to Babu? Show me Babu!
(offering a drink) Snapple?
No, too fruity.
Hey, what happened? I thought Cheryl was gonna help Babu get his Visa.
She didn't help him?
No.
Where is he?
He's in Pakistan.
Oh boy.
What do you mean, oh boy?
Well, last night she told me that she liked you. Not you, the disturbed you, so I had to tell her the truth.
Told her the truth? Well, you got Babu deported.
What do you mean, I got? You didn't give him his Visa application.
That's because she had my mail.
Yeah, well I wouldn't have had to get your mail if he hadn't gone to that fantasy camp.
Well, I just came back from Mickey Mantle's restaurant.
How could you go in there?
Well, I had to. I had to apologize. I mean, I punched Mickey Mantle, my idol. It was eating me up inside!
Well, what happened?
I got down in my knees and went, "Go ahead, Mickey. Hit me. I'm begging you, Mickey, please hit me. C'mon, hit me. I love you, Mickey, I love you!"
So, what did he do?
Well, the four of them, they picked me up by my pants and they threw me outside, right into a horse.
Kramer?
Yeah? It's my Chinese food.
Oh! Ping! Hi! Listen, thank you so much for dropping that lawsuit against me.
Not anymore.
What?
Cheryl call me last night, lawsuit back on.
Why?
She call you and your friends big liars. You think she nice girl? Wait till you see her in court. She's a shark! They call her the Terminator. She never lose a case. Now you make her mad. She double the damages. Hasta la vista, baby.
So his friend got the mail but she did not give it to him. And then he came to visit me. Said the lawyer was called to help, he said the wheels were in motion, but there was no motion. There was nothing. And so they sent me back here.
This is a terrible story, Babu. What are you going to do?
I'm going to save up every rupee. Someday, I will get back to America, and when I do I will exact vengeance on this man. I cannot forget him. He haunts me. He is a very bad man. He is a very very bad man.
Wait a second, wait a second...and then the butler says, "I'm not cleanin' it up! I'm sick of cleaning!"
That's funny, that's funny! "I'm sick of cleaning." That's very funny.
I'll tell you something, I've never seen a pilot script as funny as this!
Yeah, it's funny!
I mean, how funny is this?
It's funny.
I mean, we're not stupid, right? We know when something's funny!
It cannot not be funny! Now come on, let's stay with it, we gotta finish this today.
Okay. Hey, you know what, maybe I should give it to my therapist to read. She's smart, I trust her.
Yeah, maybe I'll give it to Elaine.
Hey, you know, we haven't brought the Elaine character into the show yet. Umm, We should try and get her into this scene.
Right, right. Okay. (Writing) Elaine enters.
Right
(Thinks) What does she say...?
I don't know, what do women say?
I don't know.
I don't even know what they think. That's why I'm in therapy.
You know, if we bring Elaine in, it's going to be so many people to keep track of. It's gonna be too hard, I'll forget where everybody's standing, you, me, Kramer, the butler, it's too much.
Alright, forget Elaine.
Alright. (They tear the pages out of their notepads. Kramer enters.)
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
You are never gonna believe who I just ran into today.
Who?
Your old flame. Gail Cunningham.
Did you talk to her?
Well, I was on my way to the Y, and I saw her coming towards me? I didn't know what to do! Because I remembered you had three dates with her and she wouldn't kiss you goodnight. So now I'm thinking you know, what is my duty to my friend? Do I acknowledge her? Do I you know ignore her? I mean, what is my responsibility here?
So what happened?
Yeah, yeah, so she sees me and she goes, (imitates Gail) "Oh, hi! Kramer!" You know? Like nothing happened! Like she never you know went three dates with you and refused to kiss you goodnight.
Yeah, I know about the three dates.
You know what I did? I snubbed her.
What do you mean, you snubbed her?
I walked right by her - bffffft - never said a word.
Right by her?
Right by her!
What you do say about a guy like this, huh! (George applauds.) You are some great friend, I tell ya, snubbed her! (seriously) Not that I condone it. I've never condoned snubbing in my administration. But your loyalty is beyond question.
Yeah. Well, you know, she was lucky I was in a good mood - coulda been a lot worse.
I'm not even in here!
Yeah, I know.
Well, I thought there was going to be a character named Elaine Benes.
Well, there were too many people in the room, we couldn't keep track of everybody. George, and the butler, and...
You couldn't "keep track" of everybody?
Well, we tried. We couldn't. We didn't know how to, uh...(confessing) ...we couldn't write for a woman. We didn't know what you would say. Even right now, I'm sitting here, I know you're going to say something, I have no idea what it is.
You have no idea?
Something derogatory? (Gail enters the coffee shop and walks over to the booth.)
I thought I'd find you here.
Well, Gail Cunningham.
Hi, Gail.
Hi, Elaine. (To Jerry) Hey, what is with your friend Kramer?
Why?
He snubbed me.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure. What did you tell him?
Nothing. (Elaine grabs Jerry's sandwich and is about to take a bite.) Hey, where you goin' with that? Gimme that. (Takes back the sandwich.)
I thought you were finished.
I took two bites, how am I finished? (Elaine coughs.) Plus you're coming down with something? You want me to get sick? (Offers Gail the sandwich) Bite?
So, how come? Why did Kramer do that?
I don't know. Once he leaves the building, he's out of my jurisdiction.
Well, tell him that I am mad at him.
Alright. So, where ya cookin' now?
Pfeiffer's.
Ah, the power lunch crowd.
Nice shoes!
Oh. Thank you.
Where'd you get 'em?
They're um, Botticelli's.
Ooh, Botticelli's! Look at you! I'm afraid to go in there.
Really.
Would you care to join us?
No, no, I gotta get to the restaurant. (Looks at her watch.) Oh! See ya. (Exits.)
See ya.
"Oh, look at you, the Botticelli's."
That bothered you?
Yes, it bothered me. So I bought a pair of shoes at Botticelli's, I'm not allowed to shop there? That really embarrassed me.
It did?
Yes! Couldn't you see that?
No. This is why you're not in the pilot.
Well, George, I think you're beginning to get some perspective on things. I think we're making progress.
Yeah, I feel like I've grown.
Good. So, let's pick up on this next week.
Great. (They both stand.) Oh, by the way, did you get a chance to read the script?
Yes, yes I did.
Well, what'd you think?
Uh...it was...good.
You didn't like it?
Well, no, I -
I can't believe this! What was wrong with it? What didn't you like about it?
It wasn't funny.
It wasn't funny? What, are you kidding?
No, I didn't find it funny.
You didn't find it funny?! This is what I'm paying for?
Well, that whole storyline about a guy who gets into a car accident, doesn't have any insurance, so the judge sentences him to be a butler? I didn't really buy that.
Let me tell you who did, uh, buy it...um we pitched this story to Russell Dalrymple, the president of NBC, and he ate it up with a spoon.
George, if you're going to be in a creative field, you're going to have to learn how to deal with criticism.
How's this for criticism? Um...you stink. How do like that criticism? You know what's funny to me? That diploma up on the wall. That is my idea of "com-med-dee"! You sitting here, telling people what to do.
I think you'd better go.
Oh, I'm goin' baby. I'm goin.' (Heads for the door, then stops.) It's Jerry's fault. He took out all my good lines. He's such a control freak!
So, you send me to this therapist to help me with my emotional disorders, and she criticizes our script. (Tosses the script to Jerry.) What kind of a therapist is that?
I guess she didn't think it was funny.
Oh, she didn't think it was funny. What is she, Rowan & Martin? We're supposed to meet with NBC tomorrow! She completely shattered my confidence. And I'm paying for this, she's my employee!
I thought your mother's paying for it.
And she slaves to earn every penny. So that someday, I might be able to walk up to a woman and say, "Yes, I'm bald, but I'm still a good person."
You know, he's right. It's not her place to criticize the script, which reminds me - what did you think of it? You never told me.
What did I think of it? (Manufactures a cough instead of answering. Kramer enters.)
Hey, buddy, I got something to tell ya. (Elaine runs towards to the bathroom in lieu of answering Jerry's question.)
Hey, one second, you don't get off that easy. C'mon, tell me what you thought.
Well, you know, I...
I just kissed Gail Cunningham. (Jerry turns and looks at Kramer, shocked. Elaine grins and heads to the bathroom.)
You what?
Yeah, I kissed her.
You kissed her?
Right on the mouth.
What kinda great friend are you? How do you go from snubbing to kissing?
Well, I saw her outside the Y, you know, she came up to me, she started yelling because I snubbed her, and then we started talking a little bit, and I walked her to her building. And just before I left, I put my arm around her waist, I pulled her to me, and I - mmm - I planted one! (Laughs.)
And what did she do?
She kissed me back.
I don't get this. I go out with this girl three times, she doesn't want to shake my hand - why's she kissing you?
Because I snubbed her. You see? Women, they like that! Yes! I understand women. The snub is good, they love the snub!
No they don't. I tried that once. I snubbed for a year. Nothing. Every woman I saw, I snubbed. You never saw people so pleased. (Elaine returns from the bathroom.)
Ooh, so...I understand you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.
What? Who told you that?
Gail Cunningham.
I don't understand, why is this woman talking about my shoes? Why are my shoes a topic of conversation?
Well, you know, we were just talking, and uh she mentioned how you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.
"How I'm buying my shoes now at Botticelli's!" Did you hear this? (Shoves Jerry and Kramer.)
So what?
So what?! She is talking about my shoes! She is discussing my shoes! It is nobody's business where I buy my shoes! (Storms over to the couch and angrily sits down. Jerry, Kramer and George look at Elaine from the kitchen, comically puzzled by her outburst...)
Hey! Gail!
Ya. (noticing it's Elaine) Elaine...!
Why are you talking about my shoes?
What?
My Botticelli shoes. You've been talking about my Botticelli shoes.
What are you talking about?
Did you or did you not tell Kramer that I got my shoes at Botticelli's? (A waiter comes over and puts a plate of food on Gail's cutting board.)
Too spicy. He wants another one. You got that pasta primavera?
Look Elaine, I am very busy here.
Who else have you mentioned my shoes to, huh? I wanna know why my footwear is your conversation!
I am not discussing this. This is insane.
You got that pasta primavera? Let's go!
Ya ya ya, here.
Here you are, Mr. Dalrymple.
Thank you.
Sorry for the delay. Enjoy your lunch.
Well, come in. (They shake hands.)
Hi.
Awfully sorry to make you come up here, but I really wasn't feeling well enough to go back to the office, and well, it's the only chance I have to meet with you this week.
Are you alright?
Well, it's my stomach. I think there must have been something in the pasta primavera I had for lunch.
Oh, Where did you eat?
Pfeiffer's.
Ah. I know the chef there.
Yeah. The food's usually terrific.
My cousin worked for Bouchard's. They used to use the bouilla-base for a toilet. (Jerry and Russell are shocked.)
What are you saying?
Well, you didn't hear it from me, but needless to say, if you go in there - stick with the consumee.
Well, we'd better get started, my daughter's going to be here soon.
Oh, you have a daughter?
Yeah, she just turned fifteen last week.
Aw, that's a fun age. (Jerry looks at George distastefully.)
Alright. The script. Now, I've read this thing three times...and everytime I read it...(looks nauseous, struggles not to vomit.)
What?
Excuse me for a second. (Gets up and runs to the bathroom.)
What?
Would you like a Pepto-Bismol? I keep them in my wallet...! (Russell goes into the bathroom and shuts the door.) (To Jerry) Do you think he liked it? (From the bathroom, we hear Russell violently heaving his guts.)
I'm not sure. (The sounds of Russell vomiting emanate from the bathroom. Jerry and George sit there uncomfortably.) What was that dish he said he had...?
Pasta primavera.
Ah. You know, 'primavera' is Italian for 'spring.'
No!
Yeah.
Really, I'm terribly sorry, it just, uh...all of a sudden it just hit me.
So, you were saying how, um...about the script...
Right. The script. Your script needs some...it needs, um...(looks nauseous again. Gets up and runs to the bathroom a second time.)
More jokes?
Another ending?
A different name for the butler? (Russell throws up again.)
Maybe we should go.
We haven't heard his notes yet, we don't know how he feels about our work. (Russell throws up yet again.)
Oh God. Oh my god.
I can't listen to anymore of this, the guy's losing a lung in there. (Russell's daughter Molly enters.)
Hello.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Molly.
Oh, I'm Jerry.
George.
We're here discussing our script with your father.
He just read it. (Russell vomits again. Jerry and George look ashamed.)
Daddy? Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah sweetie. I'm fine. (Molly sits on the back of the chair.)
So, you live with your mother, huh?
Uh, yeah.
Divorce is very difficult. Especially on a kid.
Uh huh.
Of course, I'm the result of my parents having stayed together, so you never know. (Russell comes out of the bathroom.)
Daddy, are you alright? What's the matter?
It's just a stomach thing.
Yuck.
We're going to have to do this some other time, so if you'll give me your number, I'll call you later. (Jerry and George nod. Molly takes her jacket off.)
You know, suddenly I'm in the mood for pasta primavera myself. (Jerry nudges George to sneak a peek at Molly's cleavage as she bends over and looks in her backpack. Jerry has a quick look, but George stares, hypnotized. Russell comes up behind George.)
Get a good look, Costanza?
What were you doing?
Well, it's not my fault. You poked me!
You're supposed to just take a peek after a poke. You were like you just put a quarter into one of those big metal things on top of the Empire State Building.
It's cleavage. I couldn't look away. What am I, waiting to win an Oscar here? This is all I have in my life.
Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun, you don't stare at it. It's too risky. You get a sense of it and then you look away.
All right. So, he caught me in a cleavage peek, so big deal. Who wouldn't look at his daughter's cleavage? She's got nice cleavage.
That's why I poked.
That's why I peeked. (Jerry opens the door to take some trash out, and meets Kramer and Gail in the hallway.)
Hey! What is with your friend Elaine?
What?
She comes to my restaurant, comes right in my kitchen, and starts complaining that I'm talking about her shoes.
She did?
Right in the kitchen. Disgraceful.
So, I don't want people coming into my kitchen. I think she might have sneezed all over someone's pasta primavera. Someone might have gotten sick because of her. (Kramer and Gail exit.)
Pasta primavera?
Is that what she said? (Kramer pokes his head back in the door.)
She's somethin', huh? She's a wild one. She's wearin' me out.
She is?
She's sensual. You know, with the...cooking and all. (Kramer grins happily at Jerry and leaves. The phone rings. Jerry tosses the trashbag to George.)
Hello? Oh, hi Stu.
From NBC?
(to George) Yeah. (oh the phone) What's goin' on? What? Really? Oh my god....did he give you a reason?...Oh boy. Okay. Alright. Thanks. (hangs up.) Dalrymple just cancelled the pilot. (George drops the bag, shocked.)
If you hadn't gone into her restaurant, this never would have happened.
Look, I don't like people talking about my shoes behind my back, okay? My shoes are my business. The two of you shouldn't have been looking at some fifteen year-old's cleavage anyway!
He poked me!
There was cleavage in the area. That's a reflex - (mimics nudging someone with an elbow) - cleavage-poke, cleavage-poke...
But she was fifteen.
You don't consider age in the face of cleavage. This occurs on a molecular level, you can't control it! We're like some kind of weird fish where the eyes operate independently of the head.
Alright, what's the difference. What are we gonna do now? He won't take our calls, we can't get into his office...
You know what we could do? He eats at that restaurant, Pfeiffer's? We could have Gail call us, tell us the next time he's there, go there and talk to him.
Hey, now you're onto something.
The whole thing is so stupid. Like he wouldn't do the same thing if Elaine walked by in a low-cut dress.
Yeah. Well, maybe not Elaine.
No.
But...somebody like Gail, though.
Ya.
What? What do you mean, Gail? (Kramer enters.)
Yah-hey.
Kramer, listen, I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor. The next time Russell Dalrymple comes in the restaurant, ask her if she would call me.
Alright, I'll call her right now.
Ok. (Kramer goes back to his apartment.)
What do you mean, Gail? You don't think I can attract attention? You don't think I can put asses in the seats?
Look, sweetheart, you know you've got it all. But let's face it... (Kramer comes back.)
She said she'll do it.
Beautiful.
Beautiful.
But she wants the shoes.
What?
She says she wants those shoes.
She wants my shoes? What kind of person is this? Alright! She is not getting 'em!
No, come on! I'll buy you another pair!
No, these were the last pair of these that they had!
I'll get you another one just like it!
No, but these were the only really cool ones like this! Don't you see how everybody likes 'em and how everybody talks about 'em? (Jerry, realizing Elaine's motivation, sits at the counter unbelievingly.)
Elaine, this pilot...it doesn't matter to me, it's not me I'm concerned about...it's my mother. I've been over to the hospital to see her...
Oh yeah, because she caught you jer -
Never mind!
Oh, come on, wait a second, this whole thing is ridiculous. How do I even know she wears the same size?
Alright, what size are you?
Seven-and-a-half.
Eh! Bingo.
Sauce this. (Goes to the telephone and dials.) Yeah, he's here. Oh, and one more thing...bring the shoes. (Hangs up.)
Hey! Whattaya know!
Look who's here!
Fancy meeting you here!
Oh. Hello.
Pasta primavera! Back on the horse.
You know, it's a funny thing, because after the pilot got cancelled, we hadn't heard from you.
Didn't hear anything...
Didn't know...we were wondering...what happened.
Well, it just didn't seem to be the right project for us right now. (Elaine walks by in a low-cut dress. Jerry and George look at her as she moves to the table opposite Russell.) So, what were you saying?
Oh...uh, because if it had anything at all to do with what you perceived as me leering at your daughter, I really have to take issue with that. I did not leer. (To Jerry) Did I leer?
No leer. (Elaine comes over to Russell's table.)
Uh, excuse me, are you using that ketchup?
Uh, no. (Elaine takes the ketchup and goes back to her table.)
Because, if I'm looking straight ahead, and something enters my field of vision, that's merely a happenstance. (Elaine loudly snaps and unfolds her napkin at the next table to get Russell's attention.)
Under the circumstances, I don't really feel that we should be in business together. (Elaine comes back over.)
Here's your ketchup back. You know, I had the hardest time trying to get some out. I mean, I just kept pounding and pounding on the bottom of it. Do you have any trouble?
No.
Do you have a...ketchup secret?
No, I... (finally notices Elaine)...don't have a ketchup secret. (Smiles.)
Because if you do have a ketchup secret, I would really, really like to know what it is. (Russell is pleased, and smiles at Elaine. Elaine goes back to her table, sits down, and waves at Russell.)
Field of vision, huh?
How's everything?
Mmmm.
Really good.
This pasta primavera is fabulous.
Very tasty.
How'd everything go with that NBC guy?
Great.
The pilot's back on. In fact, Elaine's going out with him tomorrow night. (Gail nods and walks away.) Listen, Elaine, you know if Russell mentions anything about the pilot, you'll of course tell him how much you liked it...?
You know, I happen to have the script right here with me and, uh...on page 3, for example, suppose the Elaine character comes in wearing a...a low-cut dress. And the butler is very distracted, and can't work.
Uh...that kind of comedy, that's a little broad for us.
Well, I'm sure it's right up Russell's alley.
Well, it's a funny idea.
It's funny!
C'mon, funny is funny.
Funny is funny, we're here to entertain, right?
Alright, well, maybe I'll mention it to Russell tomorrow night.
If you can.
Yeah. Where's he taking you, by the way?
Bouchard's, on 53rd. (George starts choking on his wine, and attempts to tell Elaine something.)
I think what he's trying to say is, "get the bouilla-base." (George nods 'yes' and continues to choke.)
I don't want to *live*! I don't want to *live*!
Because of me? You must be joking! Who wouldn't want to live because of me? I'm nothing!
No... You're *something*.
You can do better than me. You could throw a dart out the window and hit someone better than me. I'm no good!
You're good. You're *good*!
I'm bad. I'm *bad*!
You're *killing* me!
So what could I do? I couldn't go through with it. She threatened to kill herself.
Over you?
Yes. Why, is that so inconceivable?
I got two tickets to see "Guys And Dolls".
I got him a two-line phone.
Unbelievable! She's not there.
What paper does she write for?
The works for the NYU school newspaper. She's a grad student in journalism. Never been to a comedy club. Never even seen me, has no idea who I am.
Never even seen you? Gotta kinda envy that...
Y'know, you've been developing quite the acid-tongue lately...
[Proudly] Really?
Hey, who do you think is the most unattractive world leader?
Living or all time?
All time.
Well, if it's all time, then there's no contest. It begins and ends with Brezhnev.
I dunno. You ever get a good look at DeGaulle?
Lyndon Johnson was uglier than Degaulle.
I got news for you. Golda Meir could make 'em all run up a tree.
Y'know, just because you two are homosexuals, so what? I mean you should just come out of the closet and be openly gay already.
So, whaddya say? You know you'll always be the only man I'll ever love.
[indignantly] What's the matter with you?
[quietly] C'mon, go along...
I'm not goin' along. I can just see you in Berlin in 1939 goose- stepping past me "C'mon Jerry, go along, go along..."
Y'know I hear that all the time.
Hear what?
That I'm gay. People think I'm gay.
Yeah, you know people ask me that about you, too.
Yeah, 'cuz I'm single, I'm thin and I'm neat.
And you get along well with women.
I guess that leaves me in the clear...
I just thought of a great name for myself, if I ever become a porno actor.
Oh yeah, what? "Buck Naked"?
Yeah, how did you know that?
You told me that already like two months ago.
Allison bought it for me.
How you gonna get out of *that* one?
I dunno. I guess I have to wait for her to die.
He's gonna hang around if that's alright with you?
Sure, I'd like to talk to him, too.
Jerry did you wash this pear?
Yeah, I washed it.
It looks like it hasn't been washed.
So *wash* *it*.
You hear the way he talks to me?
You should hear how *my* boyfriend talks to me...
Let me ask you something. What do you think of this shirt?
It's nice.
Jerry said he didn't like it.
I didn't say I didn't like it. I said it was O.K...
No, you said you didn't like it...
Oh, so what if I don't like it. Is that like the end of the world, or something?
So how did you two meet?
Actually, we met in the gym locker room.
Yeah. Actually it was in gym class. I was trying to climb the ropes and Jerry was spotting me. I kept slipping and burning my thighs and then finally I slipped and fell on Jerry's head. We've been close ever since.
)
Do you guys live together?
[quizzically] Live together?
No, I got my own place.
)
And do your parents know?
Know *what*?
My parents? They don't know *what's* goin' on...
Oh God, you're that girl in the coffee shop that was eavesdropping on us. I *knew* you looked familiar!
There's been a big misunderstanding here! We did that whole thing for your benefit. We knew you were eavesdropping. That's why my friend said all that. It was on purpose! We're not gay! Not that there's anything wrong with that...
No, of course not...
I mean that's fine if that's who you are...
Absolutely...
I mean I have many gay friends...
My *father* is gay...
Look, I know what I heard.
It was a *joke*...
Look, you wanna have sex right now? Do want to have sex with me right now? Let's go! C'mon, let's go baby! C'mon!
)
Hey, C'mon! Let's go! I thought we were going to take a steam!
No!
No steam!
Well I don't want to sit there naked all by myself!
Happy birthday paruba!
Today's not my birthday.
Well, I beg to differ...
Look at this! A phone! A two-line phone!
Hey, where you going?
I gotta go return something...
Jerry, it's Sharon from NYU. I'm just calling to tell you that I'm not going to play up that angle we talked about and I'm sorry.
Thank you very much, that's great- >click< Oh! Hold on a sec, I got a call on the other line. >click click< Hello?
Hey.
Hey, how ya doin'? Y'know I got that reporter from the newspaper on the other line.
So, what did she say?
She says she's not going to play up that angle of the story. She thinks we're heterosexual. [sarcastically] I guess we *fooled* her. I'll get rid of her, hold on... >click click< Sharon? Hello? Sharon, are you there? >click click< I'm back...
Y'know... I could hear you on the other line...
What are you talkin' about?
I heard what you said "Sharon, are you there?".
You heard me talkin' on the other line, are you sure?
Yes, I heard you!
Well, maybe she was disconnected.
Maybe she wasn't! Maybe she heard the whole conversation!
Alright, hang on. Let me call Kramer and see if you can hear anything, hold on. >click click click<...
Yello?
Kramer, there may be a problem with the phone, hold on. >click click<
"There may be a problem with the phone, hold on"!
Oh no! >click click< Kramer, this phone's a piece of junk, goodbye!
"The phone's a piece of junk, goodbye"!
Oh no! Now she's heard everything! What are we gonna do?!?
Now she thinks we're gay, not that there's anything wrong with it...
No, no, of course not! People's personal sexual preferences are nobody's business but their own!
Why don't you take a seat?
Thank-you.
Why don't you take your coat off?
So she kept insisting I take off my coat. I refused, and then she forcibly tried to get me to remove it.
She wouldn't take her coat off at my house, either.
Y'know there are tribes in Indonesia where if you keep your coat on in somebody's house, the families go to war!
So you don't take your coat off, and now everyone at NYU thinks I'm gay. Not that there's anything wrong with that...
Not at all.
Two tickets to "Guys And Dolls"! I'm gonna go with you!
"Guys And Dolls"? Isn't that a lavish, Broadway musical?
It's "Guys And *Dolls*", not "Guys And *Guys*".
"The Collected Works Of Bette Midler".
What do you got there?
_The New York Post_, they've got an article about you.
"Although they maintain separate residences, the comedian and his long-time *companion* seem to be inseparable..." Oh no! The Associated Press picked up the NYU story. That's going to be in every paper! I've been "outed"! I wasn't even "in"!
Now everyone's going to think we're gay!
Not that there's anything wrong with that...
No, not at all...
"Within the confines of his fastidious bachelor *pad*, Seinfeld and Costanza bicker over the cleanliness of a piece of *fruit* like an old married couple--" *I told you that pear was washed*!
I thought we were friends...
Here we go...
I mean, how could you two keep this a secret from me?
It's not true!
Aaaah! Enough lying! The lying is through! C'mon, Jerry, the masquerade is over. You're thin, late thirties, single...
So are you...
Yeah--
Hello?
George?
Mrs. Seinfeld?!?
Oh, my God...
Oh, my God! [takes the phone] Ma?
Jerry?
Ma!
Oh, my God! My *MOTHER*!!!
Jerry?
Ma, it's not true!
It's those damn culottes you made him wear when he was five!
They weren't culottes, they were shorts.
They were culottes! You bought them in the girl's department.
By mistake! By mistake, Jerry! I'm sorry!
It looked like he was wearing a skirt, for crying out loud!
Ma, it has nothing to do with the culottes!
Not that there's anything wrong with that, Jerry.
I open up the paper, and *this* is what I have to read about? I fell right off the toilet. My back went out again, I couldn't move... The super had to come and get help me up. I was half naked!
It's *not* *true*!
Every *day* it's something else with you. I don't know anything about you any more. Who are you? What kind of life are you leading? Who knows *what* you're doing? Maybe you're making porno films.
Yeah. I'm Buck Naked.
Jerry, I can see. He's so neat and thin. Not that there's anything wrong with it.
Of course not...
630, Scott. Time for your sponge bath.
Alright, now the play is tomorrow night. So do you want to have dinner first, or do you just want to meet at the theatre?
Excuse me, sir? I don't mean to bother you. I just wanted you to know that it took a lot of guts to come out the way you did, and that you've inspired me to do the same, even though that may mean a discharge from the service. Thanks.
Y'know, I think I'll pass on the "Guys And Dolls"...
No. Just imagine her reaction.
Yeah...
Oh, my God...
What?
She hasn't seen the article! When she sees it, she's gonna think-- *I'm out baby*!! I'm out!!!!!
Yeah? So?
Yeah so??
Well this is nice. They mention your name.
Don't you see what it says here? Don't you understand what that's implying?
No, what?
I'm gay! I'm a gay man! I'm very, very gay.
You're *gay*?
Extraordinarily gay. Steeped in gayness.
[matter-of-factly] I don't believe it.
You don't believe me? Ask Jerry.
I will.
What do you mean you will? That's a bad idea. Jerry is a very private person.
[Grabs George's lapels] I want to hear it from *Jerry*...
Oh, can you ever forgive me?
I dunno... [they kiss again] *Alright*, I forgive you...
Y'know the funny thing is, I was attracted to you immediately.
I was attracted to you, too. You remind me of Lois Lane.
Jerry! Oh, my God! What are you doing!?!
What!?
You're with a *woman*!
I know! What are you doin' here?!?
I leave you alone for two seconds, and this is what you do! I trusted you!
[forcibly removing G. from the apt] Would you get the Hell out of here!
What's going on?
Yeah, what's going on?
Alright, tell her. Go ahead.
Tell her what?
Y'know. About *us*.
Alright, I'll tell you the truth. I'm not gay. My name's Buck Naked, I'm a porno actor.
*Really*?
We'll see you later...
He's the *phone* man!
Not that there's anything wrong with that...
"Y'know I think Joe might be a little... [waves hand back and forth]", they should vacuum "Y'know I think Joe might be >vroom< [makes vacuuming motion]. Yeah, I got a feeling he's a little >vrooom<..."
Oh, what's the point? When I like them, they don't like me, when they like me, I don't like them. Why can't I act with the ones I like the same way I do with the ones I don't like?
Well, you've only got another fifty years or so to go before it'll *all* be over...
Maybe I need someone who doesn't speak English.
Yeah, how about a mute?
A mute would be good.
Ah, where you gonna meet a mute?
This is what my life has come to... Tryin to meet a mute.
I dunno, Jerry somethin's missing. There's a void, Jerry, there's a void...
A deep, yawning chasm...
There's gotta be more to life than this. What gives you pleasure?
Listening to you. I listen to this for fifteen minutes and I'm on top of the world. Your misery is my pleasure.
Hey boys!
Hey! How you doin'?
Good. Okay, well, it's all set. I start tomorrow.
Start what?
I signed up to do volunteer work with senior citizens.
*Really*.
Yeah. God, I can't tell you how I feel! I mean, I feel *so* *good*! I *really* feel good. The strange thing is, I mean, I haven't even met the woman yet.
Volunteer work, huh?
What're you gonna do down there?
Well, they say all it is is that you go over to their apartment and, I dunno, you take them for a walk and you get a cup of coffee and it's supposed to make them feel good.
That's what I do with him [points at George]
When did you get this idea?
Last time I had lunch with you here. You were going *on* and *on* and *on* about how you wanted to meet somebody who didn't speak English.
What, do you break it in with her, then you try it out on me?
And... and anybody can do this?
Yup.
Helping people... Of course. Of course! It makes perfect sense! How could I *not* be doing this!? I am gonna help somebody, Dammit!
[To Jerry] What about you?
Nah, it's not for me.
Jerry, if anybody should be doing this, it's you.
What *kind* of a person are you?
I think I'm pretty much like you-- only successful.
This is a wonderful thing you're doing. They're so grateful just to have someone to talk to. And I can tell you that everyone who participates finds the experience extremely rewarding.
Well, I feel better already. I'm feelin' like a good person.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Hey, what's your guy's name again?
Fields. Sidney Fields. *87* years old. *87*. How about your guy?
Ben Cantwell. 85. Huh... You think we'll make it to that age?
*We*? No.
So what's up, Diggity Dog?
George and I just signed up with the Senior Citizen's Volunteer Agency. Same thing Elaine's doing.
Oh, that's too bad. Now don't say I didn't try to warn you.
What're you talkin' about?
Oh, Jerry, I'm *surprised* at you!
What?
It's a *con*. These agencies are usually a front for some money laundering scheme. Or they're bunko artists; bilkin' people out of their life savings, oh *yeah*.
Where do you *get* this?
The alternative media, Jerry. That's where you hear the truth.
Kramer?! Kramer!? Where are you? Kramer!?! Kramer!!?
I'm in here. C'mon...
Hello, *Newman*...
Jerry, George. [To Kramer] So, did you ask him about the records?
Well--
What records?
Well, Newman and I are going partners selling used records.
You know Ron's Records down on Bleeker? They pay big cash for used records!
Yeah, so we thought if you had any of those big, y'know, old-fashioned useless records, y'know, just... lyin' around--
Y'know, we'd take them off your hands, free of charge.
Let me ask you something. What do you do for a living, Newman?
I'm a United States postal worker.
Aren't those the guys that always go crazy and come back with a gun and shoot everybody?
Sometimes...
Why *is* that?
Because the mail never stops. It just keeps coming and coming and coming, there's never a let-up. It's relentless. Every day it piles up more and more and more! And you gotta get it out but the more you get it out the more it keeps coming in. And then the bar code reader breaks and it's *Publisher's Clearing House* day!!!
I'll give you five bucks.
Five bucks???
Well, you know how much those records are worth!?
Yeah, I do... Fi' dollars.
Those records are worth more than five dollars!
[In Newman's ear] He's gyppin' us...
You're gyppin' us!
Well, whattya got here, y'know, you got "Don Ho Live At Honolulu", you got "Jerry Vale Sings Italian Love Songs" you got Sergio Mendes, now come on...
Wait, wait, wait... Sergio Mendes has a cult following.
They follow him like a cult.
He can't even walk down the street in South America...
Look, that's his problem, alright? Now you don't like it, too bad.
[In Newman's ear] I don't like it...
I don't like it.
Well, then get the Hell out of my store, alright? You bring me something decent, I'll give you some money.
[In Newman's ear] Alright, well be back, jack.
Alright, well be back... *jack*!
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.
Agency?
Yeah, is this Sid Field's residence?
Sid Fields.
What the *Hell* is it?
Mr. Fields?
What!?!
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, the agency sent me.
Agency? What agency? The *CIA*?
No, no, the--
Who let you in here?
The woman, she--
Oh *her*. She *steals* from me. Steals my money. She says she doesn't speak English. My *ass* she doesn't speak English. Plays that freakin' "voo-doo" music, tries to hypnotize me. She thinks she's gonna turn me into a zombie and then rob me blind. Well, I wasn't born yesterday. I may drop dead today, but I sure as Hell wasn't born yesterday. Now get the Hell out of my house...
Mr. Fields, I'm here to spend some time with you.
Oh, really. Are you the boyfriend? I know she's got a boyfriend. Are you going to *kill* me? I'm an old man for crying out loud, you gonna kill an old man, you coward?!? [Jerry gets out card]
No, Mr. Field, look, really I'm--
I can't read that you fool...
What's all this stuff?
Trash. Garbage.
You're throwin' this out??
I believe that's what you do with garbage, you idiot.
"22 Explosive Hits", I don't know the other one. Anyone? I believe "The Beatles" (The White Album) is there also.)
You don't want any of this?
Well if I wanted it I wouldn't be throwing it away, *Ein-stein*.
You know I have some friends who would really like to have these.
Well, take it. I'm sure as Hell not going to give it to my family.
Well, do you want to go out for a walk, get a cup of coffee...
With you? I'd rather be dead.
Well, maybe I'll get goin' then. I just remembered I got an appointment to get my, um, tonsils out.
Good. Thank God. Good riddance. [pause] Oh listen, before you go, would you mind changing my diaper? HAA!!
No, I feel great for 85.
Y'know the average life span for an American male is like, 72. You're really... kinda pushin' the envelope there.
I'm not afraid of dyin'. I never think about it.
You don't? Boy, I think about it a lot. I think about it at my age. Imagine how much I'll be thinkin' about it at your age. All I'll do is keep thinkin' about it until it drives me insane...
I'm grateful for every moment I have.
Grateful? How can you be grateful when you're *so* close to the end? When you know that any second-- Poof! Bamm-O! It can all be over. I mean you're not stupid, you can read the handwriting on the wall. It's a matter of simple arithmetic, for Gods sake...
I guess I just don't care.
What are you talking about? How can you sit there and look me in the eye and tell that me you're not worried?! Don't you have any *sense*?!! Don't you have a brain!? Are you so completely senile that you don't know what you're talkin about Anymore!!?!
Wait a second, where are you going?
Life's too short to waste on you.
Wait a minute, please--
Get out of my way...
But Mr. Cantwell, you... you owe me for the soup...
Mrs. Oliver?
Yes my dear.
Ooh!
What's the trouble? Are you alright?
Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yeah.
It's my goiter, isn't it?
Did you say goiter? What goiter?
This football-shaped lump jutting out the side of my neck.
Oh, *that* goiter. Hey... Heh heh heh... Whaddya know...
Does it bother you?
Bother me? Oh, phhbt... Why would a little goiter like that bother me? No, not a bit. It's nothing. It's nothin', it's um, in fact, it's um, it's very distinctive, y'know? Um, I mean you want to know something? I, I wish I had one. [pause] Really.
C'mon Elaine, it's just a goiter...
I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't look the woman in the face. I mean I keep thinkin' that that goiter's gonna start talkin' to me... You'd think they'd mention that before they send you over there "Oh, by the way, this woman *almost* has a second head". But no, no, I didn't get any goiter information.
They really should mention that in the breakdown height, weight, goiter.
Y'know you try to do some good. You want to be a good person but this is too much to ask.
Yeah, well, I'll tell ya, I'd rather talk to a goiter with a nice disposition than the nut they sent me to.
Hey Georgie, what happened with your guy?
I don't think it's gonna work out...
Whattya mean?
He fired me.
He fired you?!?
*How* do you get fired from a volunteer job?
I dunno. I was just talking to the man and he walked out on me!
Well, I dunno about you two, but I'm quitting. I hate my guy. He's a mean, mean guy.
I wish I could quit...
So quit!
Yeah, I'm a great quitter. It's one of the few things I do well. I come form a long line of quitters. My father was a quitter, my grandfather was a quitter... I was raised to give up.
Well, here's your *albums* [Journey "Escape" is on top, BTW...]
What happened?
Five dollars. He offered us *five* dollars.
Hey, what kind of stuff are you listening to? You *embarrassed* me at that store.
That guy thought we were a couple of total squares.
Oh yeah, you and your *Sergio Mendes*...
Hey, hey, hey, hey, that guy can't even go to the bathroom in South America!
Well you shoulda seen the pile of albums this old guy I was visiting today was throwing away Sinatra, Duke Ellington, Al Jolson, Benny Goodman...
Wait, wait, wait, now... He's throwin them out??
Yeah, and then I asked him if my friend could have them and he said yeah.
Okay...
[In Kramer's ear] The old coot's sittin' on a mountain of gold!
Yeah...
But you're going to have to go get em. I'm not carryin' them all.
Yeah, but you've gotta come with us.
Yeah, I'm goin' there today. In fact you should see this house keeper he's got. She's from Senegal [and, ala Carson] Wild, Wild, Stuff...
Senegal?
So you don't speak *any* English at all?
English? No.
Hey, what are those bums doin' back there?
Well you said they could come and take the records.
It's like watchin' a couple of hyenas goin' through the garbage.
You don't speak *any* English?
No English.
I would like to dip my bald head in oil and rub it all over your body. [No reaction] You don't understand! It's a miracle! You don't understand because you don't speak English!
So Mr. Fields I just don't know if this arrangement is--
Hey, I don't like what's goin' on around here. I want all you bums outta here.
Now calm down, Mr. Fields...
Now don't tell me to calm down... Get your hands off of me! Why you little...
Oooow! He's biting me!
My teeth! My teeth!
Where's his teeth! Where's his teeth!
I thought I saw something fly over here...
Well turn the light on...
That's the garbage disposal!
My teeth! You idiots!!!
And we would take long automobile trips--
Oh, well, that sounds like a lot of fun...
Staring out the window--
Uh huh...
You'd see a long view of rolling pastures and--
Well, that'll get you goin' right there...
Big, roaming cows--
Cows, well that's fascinating...
That's when I began my affair with Mohandas.
What?
Mohandas.
Ghandhi?
Oh, the *passion*. The *forbidden pleasure*--
You had an affair with Ghandhi? MRS. O He used to dip his bald head in oil and rub it all over my body. Here, look... [shows Elaine a picture of the two together]
Oh, my God... The Mohatma?
Twenty bucks.
Twenty bucks?!? Are you out of your mind?
Well, take it or leave it.
Take it or leave it!? We got *Al Jolson* here, *Al Jolson*!!
Now what the Hell do I care about Al Jolson. I'd just assume her you sing "Mammy". Heh heh heh...
[In Newman's ear] This guy's nothin' but a piece of crap...
You are nothing but a piece of crap.
Pardon me?
[In Newman's ear] A piece of crap...
A piece of crap.
[In Newman's ear] I find you extremely ugly...
I find you extremely ugly.
*Do* you?
[In Newman's ear] You emit a foul and unpleasant odour...
You emit a foul and unpleasant odour.
Oh, is that right?
[In Newman's ear] I *loathe* you...
I *loathe* you.
That's it. Get out of my store!
[In Newman's ear] Make us.
Make us!
Oh, I'll make you!
Do you realize how irresponsible this is? Our agency's sole purpose is to care for senior citizens. And in one fell swoop you've single- handedly destroyed our reputation.
Yes, but--
[Into intercom] Yes?
It's Tim Fields, Mr. Fields' son.
Alright, c'mon up.
[To Rep] I dunno what happened, we were just trying to take him to the dentist.
Why were you taking him to the dentist?
Um, well, his false teeth got mangled up in the garbage disposal--
What were his false teeth doing in the garbage disposal?
Well, after he bit my friend--
Bit your friend?!
What the *Hell* is going on here? How do you *lose* a human being?!
I, I'm sorry.
And who were these other people. What were they doing in the apartment!?
Well, I brought them up there to take his records--
Take his *records*? Do you realize how valuable that record collection is?
Hey.
There you are. Did you find him?
No, y'know we took the old man's records over to Ron's and he tried to *screw* us so we got in a fight.
It was a real melee.
Yeah, a real brouhaha...
Oh, hi Jerry.
Hi, Sidra. I usually last about ten minutes on a Stairmaster. Unless of course there's someone stretching in front of me in a leotard, then I can go an hour.
Really.
Oh, yeah. That's why they call it a Stairmaster. You get up there and you stare.
Well, I'm done. I think I'm gonna go take a sauna.
Alright, I'll see you Thursday night, right?
Thursday night.
Alright.
Good workout?
Tremendous workout.
That's a pretty girl.
Tremendous girl.
She's the one you went out with last night?
Yeah. I really like her.
You know, uh...they're fake.
What? Don't say that!
Nah! They're fake!
How do you know?
I can tell. You know how you're always bragging how you can spot a lesbian?
I'm not bragging, I happen to have a very keen lesbian eye. (A woman walks by Jerry and Elaine.) Hi, how ya doin.' (Jerry jerks a thumb at the woman to confirm his talent. Elaine is skeptical.)
Oh, right. C'mon, don't you think they seem a bit too perfect?
Yes, they do!
I never knew you were so into breasts. I thought you were a leg man.
A leg man? Why would I be a leg man? I don't need legs. I have legs. Have you ever seen her naked in the locker room?
No.
Oh, well, then I can't accept your testimony. Maybe if you had seen her naked.
I don't want to see her naked.
Well, I do.
Well, that's your problem.
Look, you made the allegation. The least you could do is follow up.
Jerry, what am I gonna do? I'm gonna go in there and spy on her in the sauna?
Yes! Go in there! Do a little investigative journalism. I need to know!
But a few more dates and you can find out for yourself!
Don't be so sure. Look at George - he's on his ninth date with Betsy, he still hasn't gotten anywhere with her.
What's his problem?
Well, every time he tries to make a move, something screws up. Like on their last date, they were on the couch, but she was sitting on his wrong side.
Wrong side?
Yeah, she was on his right side. He can't make a move with his left hand. Can't go left.
He can't go left.
No! I'm lefty, can't go right. What about women? Do they go left or right?
Nah, we just play defense.
Can I ask you a question? Would you mind switching seats?
Oh, actually, I really prefer to sit here. I don't hear very well out of this ear (points to her right ear) so, I always try to sit to the right of people.
I'll shout.
Well, I really think I feel more comfortable here.
C'mon, c'mon...(stands up and physically rolls Betsy to the left side of the couch.) See, now, is that so bad?
What? (The phone rings.)
No, no, the machine'll get it...
No, no, it's not on...
They'll call back.
But George, what if it's an emergency?
In the whole world right now, there's maybe three emergencies. Why would you think, on this entire planet, that you're one of those three?
George, please. (Gets up and answers the phone.) Hello? What? (shocked) Oh my god!
Alright, maybe four.
Boy, I'm really sweatin.' Good sweat, beads of sweat...sweatin' bullets. (Notices Sidra.) Look at her. I don't need to see her naked to know those aren't real. Why does she need to tie the towel around her? She's got a rack on her chest. (Sidra takes her towel off and lies down.) Oh god! Sidra's takin' the towel off! (Looks at Sidra's chest.) Whoa, doctor! That's it, I knew it! I knew it, they're definitely fake.
So, when's the funeral? Well, Aunt Clarice was so ill, I guess it was really a blessing. (George, on the couch behind Betsy, is impatiently waiting for her to get off the phone so he can continue putting the moves on her. He shrugs, and crosses himself.) Yeah, I'll fly home as soon as I can. (George waves goodbye, and mimics a plane flying through the air with his hand.) O.k. You, too. Get some sleep. (Betsy looks at George, and he manufactures a completely phony look of sorrow.)
You're sure?
Positive! This chick's playin' with confederate money.
Well then, that's it. That's the end of that.
What? Just 'cause of that?
Just 'cause of that? It's like finding out Mickey Mantle corked his bat!
Oh, come on! You've dated women with nosejobs, what's the difference?
You don't touch the nose! You don't aspire to reach the nose. You don't unhook anything to get to a nose, and no man has ever tried to look up a woman's nostril.
You've put a lot of thought into this, haven't you?
Well, I take it very seriously.
You know, sometimes when I think you're the shallowest man I've ever met, you somehow manage to drain a little more out of the pool.
Hey.
Hey. You know, I do kinda wonder what fake breast feel like.
Well, I know what they feel like.
You? How do you know?
Well, I lived in Los Angeles for three months.
I thought you hated Los Angeles.
I do! I just miss the warm weather, y'know? Jeez. Oh man, I wish I could get away.
Real busy now down at the office?
No. Huh? You know who I saw at the health club? Salman Rushdie.
Yeah right, Salman Rushdie. Yeah well, I can see that - you got five millions Moslems after you, you wanna stay in pretty good shape.
I know what the problem is - I like her too much. That's why I can't make a move.
You put her on a pedestal.
I put them on a dental chair.
He puts 'em on a dental chair.
I'm not her boyfriend. I want to be her boyfriend.
Whoo. It's like a sauna in here.
That's funny. You're a funny guy.
Yeah, funny. Yeah, I never heard that before. (To George) So, you goin' to the funeral?
Why, you think I should?
What, are you kidding? It's a golden opportunity to advance the relationship. She's crying, you put your arm around her and console her...you're the consolation guy!
I'm the consolation guy...?
Consolation Guy is big.
Her aunt dying is the best thing that ever happened to you.
It's like ten dates in one shot.
This confers upon you instant boyfriend status. The family's there...you're taking care of things...you're gettin' the sandwiches...you're the rock!
It's in Detroit though, it's an expensive flight.
Why don't you get a "death in the family" fare?
What?
You go to the airlines, you tell them you got a death in the family? They give you 50% off the fare.
Really?
In fact, listen...I'll go down there with ya. You know, we'll tell them there's a death in my family, you buy the ticket, I'll split it...then I'll get the bonus miles and you'll get to Detroit for a quarter of the price!
Boy, I'm gettin' a good sweat here. Great sweat, good beads. Nice beads.
Ah, look who's here. "Silicon Valley."
So anyway, we go out on one date, he asks me out for a second, then out of nowhere he cancels the date and says he doesn't want to see me again.
Uh...sorry, I couldn't help overhearing.
Oh, that's o.k.
Did he give you a reason?
Yeah. He's going back to his old girlfriend.
Really?
He said she's mentally ill. He's one of those guys who is obsessed with neatness and order? Everything has gotta be just so. He would have made a great Nazi.
Hey, does he ever talk about Superman?
Yes! How did you know?
Oh, I know the type.
So you can relate?
Oh, yeah.
You know, I've seen you around the club. My name's Sidra. This is Marcy.
Oh, hi. I'm Elaine. (Gets up to shake Sidra's hand, but stumbles and falls "right into them.")
So anyway, I stood up to shake her hand, then suddenly I lost my balance and I fell right into her.
You fell on her?
I touched 'em.
You what?
I...touched...'em.
You touched 'em?!
I needed them to help me break my fall! If it hadn't been for them, I could have really injured myself!
Wow.
Anyway...they're real.
Excuse me?!
I think they might be real.
Oh, what do you know, you have no breast touching experience.
I've touched mine!
So have I.
Oh, right...I forgot. (smiles)
Anyway, touching two breasts doesn't make you an expert.
Alright, well anyway, I think they're real. And if they are, I must say they are...spectacular.
Aw, what are you doin' to me? (puts his head down on the counter.)
You see, my friend here, his aunt passed away last night.
Oh, I'm very sorry.
I saw her last week, she looked healthy and peaceful, but...she knew...
You poor thing!
I...I...
You don't think you can buy the ticket yourself...? No, there, there...you sit, and I'll purchase the ticket for you.
You're a good friend.
I understand you offer a 50%-off 'bereavement' fare...?
Yes, all you have to do is pay the full fare now, then return to any one of our counters with a copy of the death certificate, and we'll refund half your fare.
The death certificate?
Yes, yes, we do need documentation or you know, people could take advantage.
What kind of a sick person would do a thing like that?
I know! But it happens.
You want my friend to ask his uncle, a man who just lost his wife of 44 years, for a death certificate so that he can save a few bucks on a flight?
That would be $387 round-trip.
Alright, so you'll need my frequent flyer number, huh?
Yes.
I don't know, one minute you say they're fake, the next minute you think they're real...I don't know what to believe!
Hey, of the two of us, I'm the only one who's touched 'em.
But you were just grabbing on to them to save your life. If you were drowning and I threw you a life preserver, you think you could tell me if it was an inflatable?
I wouldn't have said anything if I knew you were going to stop seeing her!
Well, I don't mind someone with a phony personality, but I gotta draw the line somewhere.
Hey!
Hey. George off to Detroit?
Yep! And, in two days, I'm off to Puerto Rico.
Hey Kramer, by the way, I saw that guy at the health club...that is not Salman Rushdie.
Pffft - wrong.
There's Sidra.
There's Salman.
Where?
Talkin' to that woman.
Talkin' to Sidra?
If that's Sidra, she's talkin' to Salman.
I don't think that's Salman.
Well, I don't think they're real.
If that's Rushdie, they're real.
If they're real, that's Rushdie.
Well, I gotta know - I'm talkin' to Sidra.
I gotta know, I'm talkin' to Salman.
It's like a sauna in here, huh? I feel like I'm...back at the desert.
You've lived in the desert?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've uh...I've spent a little time in the Mideast. You ever been to the Mideast?
Yes, I've been there.
My name's Kramer.
Sal Bass. Pleased to meet you, Kramer.
So, uh...what kind of work do you do?
I'm a writer.
Have you met my boyfriend George?
No! (shakes George's hand.)
George, this is Aunt May, and Father Jessup. Oh, and that's my brother, Timmy. (Timmy smiles thinly.) This is my boyfriend, George.
Oh George, how nice of you to come all this way.
Well, I'm the boyfriend. Otherwise, what's the point of being the boyfriend? This is where you have to be when you're the boyfriend.
Betsy, dear, have you had anything to eat?
I'm not very hungry.
They have some very nice snacks.
I'm about to get myself a snack.
Oh, no, no, no...you sit right here...I will get you a nice snack.
This is my third wake this month. It never gets any easier.
Well, losing a loved is, uh...I mean, forget about it. (Starts wolfing down the sandwiches.)
You seem to be of great comfort to Betsy, we're very appreciative.
Oh - comfort, schmomfort. Listen, Father, can I ask you a question? In a terrible time like this...who would I get the death certificate from?
C'mon Jerry!
Oh, how can you be so sure?
Jerry, are you blind? He's a writer. He said his name was Sal Bass. Bass, Jerry! Instead of salmon, he went with bass! He just substituted one fish for another!
Look, you idiot, first of all, it's Salman, not salmon!
Jerry, Jerry, you're missing the big picture!
Alright, maybe it is, but listen, I gotta get ready - Sidra's coming over in a few minutes, so if you don't mind...
What, did you ask her?
I'm gonna find out tonight.
Oh, yes indeed...
Why do you need a death certificate?
Well, Dr, Allenwood, uh...I was hoping to compile an - admittedly, rudimentary - scrapbook of her life. Something that Betsy could have, and hold onto.
Well, I suppose I could make a copy of it.
Oh, that would be wonderful.
It was very nice meeting you, George.
Likewise.
What are you doing?
What?
Did...did you just double-dip that chip?
Excuse me?
You double-dipped the chip!
"Double-dipped"? What are you talking about?
You dipped the chip. You took a bite. (points at the dip) And you dipped again.
So...?
That's like putting your whole mouth right in the dip! From now on, when you take a chip - just take one dip and end it!
Well, I'm sorry, Timmy...but I don't dip that way. (takes a chip.)
Oh, you don't, huh?
No. (dips the chip) You dip the way you want to dip...(bites the chip) I'll dip the way I want to dip. (dips the chip again.)
Gimme the chip! (Grabs George and the chip goes flying.) Gimme the chip! (They struggle in front of the snack table.)
I don't know what I'm doing here, I must be crazy. (Moves to the couch and sits on the left side. Jerry tries to run over and beat her to it, but doesn't make it. He sits down on the right side.)
Hey, would you mind switching seats?
Why?
Oh, I don't know...I just like sitting to the left of people, makes me feel like I'm driving.
O.K....(they switch places.)
How ya doin'?
Good. How you doin'?
Good, feel good...you know that Jayne Mansfield had some big breasts. Really big, huge...just coming out the top of her dress, they were like, chokin' her.
I hear that's how she died.
Have you noticed that women today are, you know, they seem...bigger.
Well, a lot of women are having them done.
Really?
Yeah.
How do you like that.
A lot of people ask me if I've had mine done.
Aw, you know people.
It gets a little tiring, it's really none of their business.
Oh, the nerve. You know, some people have asked me if you've uh, done that.
What do you tell them?
Whatever you want me to tell them.
Well, I think you'll find out soon enough. (They prepare to kiss. There's a loud bang on the door.) Aren't you going to get that?
No.
What if it's an emergency?
Oh, there's no emergency...
Jerry! C'mon, it's an emergency!
Excuse me. (Gets up and answers the door.) Alright, what is it? You're interrupting!
Well, you know, I'm packing for Puerto Rico, I need to borrow your bathing suit.
This is an emergency? You need a bathing suit?
Well, I like yours.
I don't know, my bathing suit? That's a little familiar, I don't want your...your boys down there.
C'mon, what's wrong with my boys?
Your boys should stay in their neighborhood.
Alright, c'mon!
Alright. It's in the top drawer. Hurry up. (Kramer goes to get the suit. Elaine enters.)
Hi, Jer.
Oh, hi, Elaine.
Oh...hi, Sidra -
Hi...Elaine? (Kramer comes back into the living room.)
What are you doing here?
I'm looking for Kramer.
Yeah, she was just showing me pictures of places I can visit when I go to Puerto Rico...you know, when you two went down there?
Oh. yeah. Alright. (pushes Kramer and Elaine out the door, then sits next to Sidra on the couch.) So, where were we?
I was just leaving.
Right, you were leaving.
I can't believe you sent a woman into the sauna to do that.
That was an accident!
I think you're both mentally ill. (leaves, then opens the door again.) And by the way...they're real, and they're spectacular. (Sidra leaves.)
Stop it, George! Get out! Get out! I never want to see you again!
Go back to New York! Get out!
Alright sir, now all I need is a death certificate and you'll be on your way.
Well, you see, what happened was...the doctor - the very same doctor that was attending to my late aunt - suffered an untimely stroke, and lost the use of his right hand, so...obviously I was unable to get the death certificate. However, I do have this. (Reaches inside his coat and takes out a Polaroid photo.)
What's this?
That's a picture of me next to the coffin.
Nice try.
Not even close, huh?
You can't just *have* an adultery-- you *commit* adultery. And you can't even *commit* adultery unless you already *have* a commitment. So you have to make the commitment before you can even think about committing it. There's no commit without the commit. Then, once you commit, then you can commit the adultery. Then you can get caught, get divorced, lose your mind and they have you committed. But y'know some people actually *cheat* on the people that they're cheating with. Which is like, y'know, being in a hold up and then turning to the robber next to you and goin' Alright, gimme everything you have, too''.
You met her at the supermarket? How did you do that?
(flips a roll of paper towels in the air) Produce section. *Very* provocative area. A lot of melons and shapes. Everyone's squeezing and smelling... It just happened.
(laughs-hu) So when're you gonna see her?
Tonight.
What's her name?
I... don't... know...
How could you not know her name?
I was a little nervous, I got distracted. It has something to do with a car, or a fish...
Look at that. Why do I get bananas? They're good for *one* day...
Oh my God, I forgot to tell you. I got a letter today from the State Controller's Office. Y'know when I was going to public school back in Brooklyn, every week I used to put fifty cents in the Lincoln Savings Bank.
Yeah, I did that too.
Yeah, You remember the, the little eh, bank book, there?
Sure.
Alright, so I haven't put anything in it since sixth grade, I completely forgot about it. The State Controller's Office tracks me down. The interest has accumulated to 1,900 dollars. 1,900 dollars! They're sending me a cheque!
Wow!
Hu-Yeah, interest. It's an amazing thing. You make money without doing anything...
Y'know I have some friends who try and base their whole life on that principle.
Really? Who?
Nobody you know...
Maybe I'll go down to the track. Put it all on a horse...
Why don't you put it in the *bank*?
The *bank*? This is *found* money. I want to *parlay* it. I wanna make a big score!
*Oh*, you mean you wanna *lose* it...
Yeah... All right....Ya got it, eh.
Yes I did.
Yes.
What's with the gloves?
Well, I'm staining my floors, y'know, I don't want to get my hands dirty...
Huh. What, the whole apartment?
The whole apartment. And I'm buying that fake wood wallpaper. I'm gonna surround myself in wood. It's gonna be like a log cabin. 'Cuz I *need* wood around me. Wood, Jerry [Snaps fingers]... Wood.
Wood is good.
Definitely.
So we're still going to the health club to play racquetball right?
Yeah, yeah, whenever you're ready.
O.K., soon as Elaine gets here.
Yep.
What, you rented "Home Alone"?
Yeah.
I thought you saw that already...
No, I saw "Home Alone II".
Oh, right... But you *hated* it!
Well I was lost, I never saw the first one. By the way, you mind if I watch it here?
What for?
Because if I watch it at my apartment I feel like I'm not doing anything. If I watch it here, I'm out of the house; I'm doing something.
All right.. Go ahead.
Yeah?
(on the intercom) It's me, are you ready to go?
No. Come on up.
I can't work with these!
What's wrong?
Well, you bought me dishwashing gloves. There's no *fine touch*...
You said "gloves"...
No, no, these are too thick. (removes the gloves/tosses them on the kitchen counter)
Oooh, is that "Home Alone"?
Yeah. The *original*.
Hey Boys-O!
(in unison) Heyyyyyyyy.
Hey, how's it goin'?
Hello.
(to Kramer) Hey (snaps fingers) get your stuff, let's get going.
Well wait a minute, there's a slight change of plans.
What?
eh, Remember Roy, the artist?
Oh, the "triangle" guy.
Yeah, exactly, the "triangle" guy.
Yeah, you liked him. What happened with him?
Yeah I did. He was very talented. He was, ah just, I don't know a little too...
Artsy?
Fat.
Oh. (unh - very quiet sigh)
He was a fat, starving artist, y'know. That's very rare.
Yeah.
Anyway, he's in the hospital, he's having surgery and I feel like should go visit him.
What's wrong with him?
Unh, something with his spleen. Anyway it'll just take five minutes, O.K., and then, the hospital is right on the way.
Yeah. (putting hand to his mouth, hatching a thought)
All right we'll wait for you.
Yeah, maybe I can get some rubber gloves there huh, yea.
Listen, Jerry can you do me a favor? (clears throat) Could you, go into the room with me to visit him because ah, I don't want him to think that I'm, y'know... interested.
Oh, you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend.
Well...
Well I think I can do that. I believe I've played that role before to some critical acclaim.
Aha ha ha (laugh)
All right, lets go.
All right (picks up his sports bag)
Yep yep yep.
What's with him?
Y'know a lot of people have asked that...
Roy!
*Elaine*! What a *surprise*. (sitting up)
(gasp) Oh, my *God*! I hardly recognize you! You look so...
Yeah, ya know, I've lost some weight...
A *lot* of weight. (enthusiastically)
I know.
Aha hu, You look *terrific*.
Thank you. So do you.
Ah hahaha hhuu ha (flirty laughing)
Ah, This is... uh... you *really* lost weight.
Thank you.
Jerry, uh, I'm the boyfriend. (puts his arm around Elaine's shoulder, but she shrugs it off twice)
Doctor Wittenberg, Outside call. Doctor Wittenberg, Outside call.
AHAaaaaaaaaa! (scream)
(a bit startled) Ahh.
Doctor Wittenberg, Outside call.
Ah, the mother lode! (the door squeaks a bit as he pushes it open)
I can't believe it! You were *huge*! Like blubber! I couldn't even get my arms around you...
Yesss, I remember.
Ahahaha. Well that's the positive thing about getting sick, you get to lose weight.
Elaine, it wasn't the illness. It was you.
Me?
(quietly- yeah) After you stopped seeing me, I was devastated. I couldn't eat for weeks.
*Get* *out*!
Really, it's the truth.
Jerry, did you hear this? He couldn't eat for weeks...
That's terrible...
I had no idea I had that kind of effect on you.
You did.
You know I can't get this *damn thing* to sleep. (about the Yo-Yo)
Now listen Roy, tell me something. When, are you gettin' out of here?
Next Thursday.
Okay, I'll tell you what. How about on Friday I take you out for a *big* meal because *you* are getting *too* thin...
Honey... Aren't we going to the Poconos next Friday?
No that's the week after.
No, I believe it's next week.
You're wrong.
No I'm not...
Shut up...
Pay dirt! (holding up the hand full of gloves. He looks behind himself as the door closes)
Uh Roy, this is uh Kramer -- he's one of our friends.
Oh, How do you do?
Yeah... I do great, yeah.
Hi Roy.
Oh, hey Dr. Siegel.
Hey Doc, check this out. [does an around-the-world with the Yo-Yo]
Heey.
I *just* learned that. (proudly holding the Yo-Yo)
A-hu. (The doctor is at a loss)
I just wanted to stop by -- see if you had any questions about tomorrow's operation.
Ah, Yeah Yeah, I have a - I have a question, um -- What do you know about inter-abdominal retractors?
Are you asking because you saw "20/20" last night?
I sure am.
Well that report was about *one* very specific type of retractor and I can assure you we do not use that retractor in your friend's procedure.
But you *will* use... a retractor.
We have to...
Mmm-hmm... (turns and walks away, makes a face, raises his eyebrows, nodding his head, then turns back to the group.)
Tell you what. You're obviously concerned about your friend's welfare. A few of my students will be observing tomorrow's operation from the viewing gallery. How would you like to watch it with them?
I'd love to watch the operation, yeah!
I dunno...
Oh, come on Jerry. You gotta see the operation. They're gonna cut him open -- His guts'll be all over the place...
Yeah, that's true...
...They'll saw through bone. Uuuuuuuing yutyutyutyutn naannnaaa [makes saw noises while gesturing over Roy's chest] You'll see what's *inside* bone...
Ttu (wipes nose and sniffs) Ttu.
Hey.
Hi...
What are doing, you crying??
No... (takes off his glasses and wipes his eyes with his sleeve)
You crying from "Home Alone"??
The old man got to me.
Alright, just get yourself together... I dunno if I can be friends with you anymore after this display.
Oh Shut up! What are you doing back so soon, anyway? (puts the tape back in it's case.)
Oh, I never even got to the gym. Kramer got the gloves, wanted to come home and start working on his floor.
Oh. How's the guy?
Oh, he's okay. In fact him and Elaine are getting ah, pretty chummy. Now Elaine wants me to buy some of his art. (opens the fridge and gets a bottle of water.)
Hnh. That's nerve...
Yeah, so she and "Triangle Boy" can go out to fancy restaurants. (takes a sip of water)
Y'know what it is? It's "Clara Nightingale Syndrome." He falls ill; she falls in love.
You mean Florence Nightingale. **
see short bio at end of script **)
What'd I say? Clara?
Yeah, you must have meant Clara Barton. **
see short bio at end of script **)
Clara Barton? What did she do?
I'm not sure, but I think she was nice. (takes a sip of water)
Susan B. Anthony** I think I'd have a problem with.
see short bio at end of script **)
Yeah, I think you would.
So, you gonna buy his art?
No. Why don't you buy it? You got 1,900 dollars.
Yeah, that's what I want-- triangles. Alright, I'm outta here. Have fun with what's-her-name.
I will.
Y'know, now you gotta ask her her name. It's so embarrassing.
No, it isn't. I can find out.
Yeah? How?
There are ways.
Y'know I remember when I was a kid growin up, kids would make fun of my name like you wouldn't believe-- "Jerry Jerry Dingleberry", and-hu "Seinsmelled"...
"Seinsmelled"?
Yeah. a-hu. What about you? Did people make fun of your name?
Are you kidding? They were merciless! What do you expect when your name rhymes with a part of the female anatomy?
(con't) Of course, not everybody can be as sweet as you are.
Oh, oh Jerry...
Oh... *you*...
Now let's try "breast"... Celeste... Kest...
No.
Rest... Sest... Hest...
"Hest"? That's not a name.
What, you should've just asked her.
I know, I should've asked her.
What're you gonna do now?
I dunno. I can't ask her now; I've already made out with her. Once you make out with a woman, you can't ask her her name.
Aretha! (points finger at Jerry)
No...
Bovary! (points finger again at Jerry)
Alright, that's enough. (sips coffee)
Alright, well you know what'cha gotta do, you gotta go through her purse. Y'know, the-the credit cards, driver's license...
How am I gonna do that?
When she goes to the bathroom.
Ah, (smacks hands) there you are. My date stood me up. Listen, will you guys go to the operation with me?
You asked a date to go to the operation?
Yeah... So c'mon, (smacks hands and rubs them together) what d'you say?
What kind of operation is it?
Spleenectomy.
Isn't that where they remove the--
No No, Don't ruin it for me, I haven't seen it yet! Ah-C'mon, what d'you say?
Mulva! (again pointing finger at Jerry -- Kramer watches the exchange back and forth)
Mulva? (waves off George with his hand)
C'mon, C'mon. You wanna go? (pats Jerry a couple times on the shoulder quietly) C'mon. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Alright, alright. Just let me finish my coffee... then we'll watch 'em go slice this fat bastard up. (sips coffee)
Now we'll open the peritoneal cavity, exposing the body's internal organs. Nurse-- retractor.
What are you eating?
Junior Mints. Do you want one?
No...
Now, I can't see..... Psst.... Psst...
... Cou, ye, ge...
Y-ea (pours a few more Junior Mints into his hand and eats them)
Where'd you get those?
The machine. You want one?
No.
Here, take one.
I don't want one.
No, they're good! Take one..
I don't want any!
Just take one.
No! Stop it! Kramer, stop it!
"Bingo" -- with a small "splat" sound -- falls into Roy, the patient. The surgical team looks around puzzled as to what just happened -- but they continue on with the operation)
(pointing at the operation he mouths the words) Did it go in?
Ge--
...Over the balcony, bounced off some respirator thing *into* the patient!
What do you mean "into the patient"?
Into the patient, *literally*!
Into the hole?
Yes, the hole!
Didn't they notice it?
No!
How could they not notice it?!?
Because it's a little mint. It's a *Junior* Mint.
W-ca-What did they do?
They sealed him up with the mint inside.
They *left* the Junior Mint *in* him?
Yes!
I-I guess it can't hurt him... People eat *pounds* of those things.
Yes they *eat* them. They don't put them next to vital organs in their abdominal cavity!
Yeah.
It's me.
Come on up.
Hey. This wallpaper is *very* good. My place looks like a ski lodge!
Why did you force that mint on me? I told ya I didn't want the mint!
Well, I didn't believe you.
How could you not believe me?!?
Well who's gonna turn down a Junior Mint? It's chocolate, it's peppermint-- it's *delicious*!
That's true.
It's very refreshing!
Well, just don't say anything about this to Elaine...
Prognosis... negative.
Prognosis *negative*!?
He's not doing well, the doctors don't know what it is. They're baffled.
Oh, my God...
Just my luck, y'know... just when he's getting thin and attractive. Y'know Jerry, you should buy some of his art. That would really lift his spirits.
It's that bleak? (pours a glass of milk)
Mmm... (Elaine goes to the bathroom)
Y'know if the guy dies, the art could really be worth something...
We gotta confess.
Really?
Yes!
We could be tried for murder...
I can't have this on my conscience. We're like Leopold and Loeb! **
see short bio at end of script **)
You're not gonna say anything, you got that?
I'm telling and you can't stop me!
You're *not*!!!
Hey Elaine? Put me down for some of that art. 1,900 dollars worth.
Oh yeah, that's the spot...
What're you so tense about?
Oh, nothing really, just a homicide. [She finds the right spot on his back] Oh that's terrific... Mulva.
What?
Mulva?
Mulva?
Oh my eh, my Aunt's name is Mulva. She's-she's a masseuse.
huh.
Yeah.
Um, I'm going to the bathroom. I'll be right back.
Oh, good idea...
What are you doing?
Oh, I was just looking for er, some... gum or... mint.
Oh, I have Junior Mints.
No! [throws her purse back at her] No, I mean, no thank you, nah...
Any news?
[whispering] No, no news. You better get out of here.
Oh.
Oh No, wait a second... Wait a second... I-I don't know the name of this woman in the bathroom, so when she comes out, you introduce yourself and then she'll be forced to say her name.
10-4.
O.K. (closes the apartment door)
Oh, hello.
Hello, I'm Kramer.
Nice to meet you.
See you later. (He promptly turns and leaves)
Well, I better get going. I don't want to be late for the play. (Grabs her coat.)
Oh, okay.
Y'know my cousin knows the producer. I may get to go backstage and meet Olympia Dukakis.
Oh, Hey, there's a name you don't forget.
Mm. Bye Jerry.
Bye.
Oh, hi.
Oh, Hi, I'm George. (they shake hands)
Oh, Nice to meet you, George.
Yeahaha, I gave it a shot (pats Jerry on the arm)... So, any word on the "artiste"? (puts a video in the VCR)
No, I haven't heard anything.
Hehe. Well, I got my triangles. (sitting on the couch)
Really...
Yup, y'know, they really spruce up the apartment.
Yeah, I'm sure...
Well, I-I gotta call the Hospital. I gotta tell 'em what happened.
No-no Jerry. I wouldn't do that.
Why?
Ehh, You could get in trouble.
Look, I gotta try and help the guy.
Who are you to play God!? Every man's time comes! If his number is up, who are you to interfere!?
Yes I'd like to speak with Dr. Siegel... it's about Roy Kordic's condition...
W-What? What?
Oh, that's *fantastic*!
He didn't get better, did he?
Thank you very much. O.K. Bye-bye. He's gonna be okay!
Where's the luck? There's no luck. 1,900 dollars down the drain.
You saved my life, George. You buying my art is what inspired me to get better. I'll never forget what'cha did for me.
Oh, well th-that's great. It's really great. Hm hm mm.
Y'know, art's a great investment.
And they're gonna look great in your apartment, George.
Yes I look forward to many years of... looking at the triangles. Well, I'll ah, I'll wait for you outside.
Hey, George...
Yeah.
Awe, alright
That's nice.
Thanks Roy.
Heeyy - there's the guy who saved my life. (points at the doctor.)
Y'know... I don't want to totally discount the emotional element in your recovery but, I think there were other factors at play here.
What do you mean?
I have no medical evidence to back me up but, something happened during the operation that staved off that infection. Something beyond science. Something perhaps, from above...
Mint?
Those can be very refreshing.
So Elaine... Where are we going for our big dinner on Friday? (takes a big mouthful of spaghetti)
Uh-m, uh I'm so sorry Roy, but actually, we are going to the, Poconos on Friday, right honey? (pointing to Jerrythe boyfriend?)
I don't think so...
We are... that means that we ah, we are...
I believe we're not...
(Catching another glimpse of Roy eating) Hunh, Please can we go to the Poconos?
Well, I'll think about it...
Great seats. You could see the actors spitting.
Really...
Uh-huh. And afterwards we went backstage and Olympia Dukakis autographed my playbill.
Oh, Wait a second, you got her autograph?
Yeah.
Do you have it with you?
Yeah, it's in my purse.
Ah, Le'me see. (hands Jerry the playbill)
Y'know I really think I'm falling for you, Jerry Seinfeld. (stands up, a quick kiss on the cheek and hugs him.)
Oh, well, I really think I'm falling for you... [opens the playbill and flips five pages till he finds and reads autograph] .....Joseph Puglia...
I had it autographed for my uncle.
Yeah, I-I know...
(licks he lips) You don't know my name, do you?
Yes I do.
What is it?
It-it rhymes with a female body part.
What is it?
Mulva...
Aub, ah, Gipple?
Loleola?
Oh! Oh! *Delores*!
Ages zero through ten, candy is your life. There's nothing else. Family, friends, school-- they're only obstacles in the way of getting more candy. And you have your favorite candies that you love. You know the ones I love those... I hate those...''. ``I hate those... I love those...''. And only a seven year old kid could actually taste the difference between like a red M&M and a light brown, M&M. That's two totally different things when you're seven years old. "Well, your red is more of a main course M&M, but the brown it's more of a mellower flavor; it's an after dinner M&M, really''.
...And it *is* embarrassing, because a doggie bag means either you are out at a restaurant when you aren't hungry, or you've chosen the stupidest possible way to get dog food that there is. How about the doggie bag on a date? That's a good move for a guy, huh? Lemme tell you something if you're a guy and you ask for the doggie bag on a date, you might as well have them just wrap up your genitals too. You're not going to be needing those for awhile, either.
Is that bothering you?
No, not at all...
Oh, could you please hurry?
[mockingly] "Please hurry". Look at you. Look at what you've become.
What? What have I become? I haven't "become" anything...
Oh, *Carl* can't wait a few more minutes?
I don't want to keep him waiting...
He'll like you more...
That's impossible...
Andrew, why do you have to pick your teeth at the table?
Leave me alone.
Yeah, I'm wanting to get married *real* soon...
So, where am I dropping you?
His place...
This guy's got quite a racket. I take you to dinner and then drop you off at his apartment...
*And* he gets the rest of my chicken...
So, is tonight "the night"?
You never know...
Oooh! Bay-bee *doll*!
Boy, do you smell something?
Do I smell something? What am I, hard of smelling? Of *course* I smell something.
What is it?
I think it's B.O.!
What?
It's B.O. The *valet* must have had B.O.
It *can't* be. Nobody has B.O. like this.
Jerry. It's *B*.*O*.
But the whole car smells.
So?
So when somebody has B.O., the "O" usually stays with the "B". Once the "B" leaves, the "O" goes with it.
I can't believe you ski!
I'm a great skier.
Yeah? What else?
Let's see... I ski, I fish, I pillage, I plunder...
[delightedly] Oh! You "pillage and plunder"?
...When I travel.
See? Finally, *finally* I get to meet a man who pillages and plunders! I'm so lucky.
This'll only take a second.
Yeah, I'm going to poke around...
[to himself] Hey, whatd'ya know? Look at that! A *lesbian* sighting. Oh-ho! My lucky day. They're *so* fascinating. Why is that? Because they don't want us. You gotta respect that...
[to himself] Oh, my God! It's Susan! What do I do?
George?
[to himself] Argh! [to Susan] Susan! Hi! Oh, boy! What are you doing here?!
Renting a video! What do you got there?
Oh, ... some stupid movie...
This is Mona.
Oh, hi...
Pleasure to meet you.
Yes. Well...
Well, I'll let you two, uh... catch up.
You okay?
Yeah. Yes! I just haven't seen you in a long time.
And you didn't expect me to be holding hands with a woman.
Oh, *please*! Me? C'mon! That's *great*! Are you kidding? I think thats fan*tastic*! I've always encouraged experimentation! I'm the first guy in the pool! Who do you think you're talking to?
I *know* who I'm talking to.
Of course you do... It's just, uh, y'know, I-I never *knew*, uh, that, uh...
I liked women?
There you go.
So, uh, how long has this been going on?
Since you and I broke up.
Ssssso, after me, you... went that way?
Yeah.
Oh, I think that's fantastic. Good for you. Nice. That's very nice.
So, what have you got there?
Oh, I, uh--
Oh, ``Rochelle, Rochelle''
It's a foreign movie... a *film*, is what it is, actually.
Yeah... A lot of nudity in that, huh?
No, no, no... Just a *tiny* bit... It's not even *frontal* nudity. It's... *sidal* nudity...
Next.
Oh, that's me.
Alright, well... Good seeing you, George.
Yes, good to see you, too. And Good luck with, uh... with the whole thing, there.
Uh, what are you returning?
[embarrassed pause] ``Rochelle, Rochelle''.
Ah, ``Rochelle, Rochelle''... "A young girl's strange, erotic journey from Milan to Minsk"...
Uh, that'll be, uh... $3.49.
$3.49? It says $1.49.
Well, you didn't rewind it. There's a $2.00 charge for not rewinding.
What! There's no signs here! This is an outrage!
George, don't give him any money for that. It'll cost you less to keep it another day, rewind it and bring it back tomorrow. Don't give him the satisfaction.
I'm not giving you the satisfaction. I'm gonna watch it again...
So, this morning I go down to the garage to check the car out. I figure by this time, the odour molecules have had at least twelve hours to de-smellify. I open the car door, like a *punch* in the *face*, the stench hits me-- it's almost as if it had *gained* strength throughout the night...
Y'know I can think of at *least* six known offensive odours that I would *rather* smell than what's livin' in your car.
What about skunk?
I don't mind skunk.
Horse manure?
I *loooove* horse manure.
Well, I've never seen anything like this in my life. In fact, I went to the car wash, they want 250 dollars to detail it, and get the smell out. I'm not payin' for that. That's not my responsibility. In fact, I'm drivin' up to that restaurant now, and *demand* they pay for it.
Absolutely.
Listen, lemme ask you something. When you're with a guy, and he tells you he has to get up early, what does that mean?
It means he's lying.
Wow...
Why? Is that what he told you?
Yeah, last night. Oh, come on... Men *have* to get up early some time...
No. Never.
Jerry! I'm *sure* I've seen men on the street early in the morning.
Well, sometimes we do actually have to get up early, but a man will *always* trade sleep for sex.
Is it possible I'm not as attractive as I think I am?
Anything's *possible*...
What's the matter with you?
Steinbrenner! He's ruinin' my life...
Oh yeah, Steinbrenner...
I don't think I can take another season with him, Jerry. He'll just trade away their best young prospects, just like he did with Beuner, McGee, Drabek... McGriff...
I know the list...
What's that smell?
What smell?
Ooooh... You stink.
Whatd'ya mean I stink?
You *stink*. Why don't you go take a shower?
I showered! Oh, wait a second... Since I showered, I've been in the car!
So?
Don't you see what's happening here? It's attached itself to me! It's alive!
If it attached itself to you, then... Oh, my God! That's why Carl said he had to get up early! Because I stink! Jerry, he thinks I have B.O.! Me!
What happened?
What happened? My car *stinks* is what happened. And it's destroying the lives of everyone in it's path.
What is that? B.O.?
Yeah.
This is *unbelievable* B.O.
I know... I was at the car wash this morning and the guy told me in his 38 years in the business, he's never smelled anything like it.
So, let me ask you. Do you think I could have done this?
No, no. It's the valet guy.
No, no, I mean, driving Susan to lesbianism.
Oh... No, that's ridiculous.
What if her experience with me *drove* her to it?
Suicide, maybe, not lesbianism.
The woman she's "lesbianing" with? Susan told me she's *never* been with a guy.
Oh, this isn't even B.O.! This is *beyond* B.O.! It's *B*.B.O.!
There should be a B.O. squad that patrols the city like a "Smell Gestapo". To sniff 'em out, strip 'em down, and wash them with a big, soapy brush...
Y'know, the funny thing is, somehow I find her more appealing now... It's like if I knew she was a lesbian when we went out, I never would've broken up with her.
Lemme see if I understand this... On second thought...
Here he is... that's the guy! (rolls up window) No, thank you, go back... go back... I'll park it! You go back!
What do you mean-- "stunk up"?
I mean the car *stinks*! George, does the car stink?
Stinks.
Stinks!
Well, perhaps *you're* the one who has the odour...
Hey, I've never smelled in my *life*, buddy!
Really? Well, I smell you now.
That's from the car!
Well, maybe *you're* the one who stunk up the car, rather than the car stinking up you!
Oh, it's the chicken and the egg...
Thank you very much... Well, then go out and smell the car; see which smells worse.
I don't have time to smell cars.
Forget about smelling the car. Smell the valet. Go to the source...
You've gotta smell the car
I'm a busy man
C'mon! One whiff!
Alright, one whiff...
Alright! I give up! I admit it! It stinks! Now will you let me out!
Alright, will you pay for the cleaning?
Yes! 50 dollars! I'll give you 50 dollars!
I'm not paying for *that*. They've already got my seven dollars... [sarcastically] "...erotic journey from Milan to Minsk"...
The valet had such bad B.O.?
Oh, man, just *rampant*, **mutant** B.O. The "O" went from the valet's "B", to the car, to me. It clings to everything. Jerry thinks it's an entity. But I showered and I shampoo'ed, so...
That's a relief...
What?
It's still there...
No, no, no! It *can't* be! I shampoo'ed! I rinsed! I repeated!
Listen, I gotta ask you I was a little concerned that perhaps I was responsible in some way for your, uh... metamorphosis.
That'll be $98.00.
What $98.00?
That's what I said. $98.00.
How could that piece of *crap* cost $98.00!?
So, was it me?
Oh, don't be ridiculous! Is that what you wanted to talk to me about? [Gives him the $35] Here.
Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot. I'll pay you back.
Yeah, *sure*... I gotta go.
Listen. Let me ask you something. If you and Mona were ever to... dance, how do you decide who leads? I mean... do you take turns? Do you discuss it beforehand? How does that work?
You're an idiot.
Why? That's a *legitimate* sociological question.
I'll see ya. And George, by the way... You stink... Real bad.
It's not me! It's the car!
I didn't think I'd come.
I knew you would.
Oh, Kramer!
We spray everything with Ozium-D, let it de-ionise, vacuum the spray out with a de-ionising machine. Hit it with high-pressure compressed air, and wet-dry vac it to extract the remaining liquids. We top it off with one of our seven air-fresheners, in your case, I would recommend the Jasmine, or the Potpourri.
Let's do it.
The first thing we're gonna do is flush the follicles with the five essential oils. Then, we put you under a vapour machine, and then a heated cap. Then, we shampoo and shampoo and condition and condition. Then, we saturate the hair in diluted vinegar-- two parts vinegar, 10 parts water. Now, if that doesn't work, we have one last resort. Tomato sauce.
Tomato Sauce?
Wait a minute! It still smells! It still smells!
It still smells.
It still smells!
How could it still smell after all that?
I don't know!
Well, what are you gonna do?
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm selling that car!
You're *selling* the car!?
You don't understand what I'm up against. This is a force more powerful than anything you can imagine. Even *Superman* would be helpless against this kind of stench. And I'll take anything I can get for it.
Maybe I'll buy it.
Are you crazy? Don't you understand what I'm saying to you? This is not just an odour-- you need a *priest* to get rid of this thing!
I still smell!
You see! You see what I'm saying to you? It's a presence! It's the beast!
Kramer! Kramer! Kramer, open up, I know you're in there!
Susan!
Kramer!
What is going on?
You know what's going on? First, he vomits on me. Then, he burns down my father's cabin. And now, he's taken Mona away from me.
He stole your girlfriend?
Yes. She's in *love* with him.
Amazing. I drive them to lesbianism, he brings 'em back.
That's the *least* of what you've accomplished...
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Kramer, Kramer... Hold on a second. I don't get this. This woman has *never* been with a man her *entire* life--
I'm Kramer.
I know what you're going through. Women. Who knows what they want?
I just don't know what she sees in *Kramer*.
Listen. You're beautiful. You're intelligent. You'll meet other girls...
You think so?
Yes, I know so. You happen to be a very eligible lesbian.
You're very sweet...
Hey, I know what I'm talking about. I gotta be honest with you, I gotta tell ya... Ever since I saw you holding hands with that woman, I can't get you out of my mind.
Really?
Yeah, you're just so... hip.
Oh, my God...
What?
It's Allison. I dated her right after you. She's obsessed with me.
George?
Allison! Hi! Oh, my God! How are you?
Good. You know, you owe me $50...
Right. I don't have it on me. Allison, this is Susan. Susan, Allison.
Nice to meet you...
Nice to meet you...
That's a beautiful vest...
Thank you...
I don't understand it. I was with her last night in my apartment; it was very romantic. Y'know with that fake wood wallpaper, the atmosphere is *fabulous* in there, now. It's like a ski lodge.
What year did you say this was?
'90.
Anyway, we were on the couch, I move to hug her, next thing she tells me she's leaving; she's got to get up early.
That's strange...
How many miles you got on this thing?
23 000.
And I was looking good, too. I had a nice, new shirt on, I'm wearing *your* jacket...
Wait a second... My jacket! I wore that in the car! The Beast!
I can't sell this car.
This... **thing**... has got to be stopped!
So, what do you want to do?
Sauce me.
I have a friend who is about to get married, they're having the bachelor party and the bridal shower on the same day... So it's conceivable that while she's getting the lingerie, he'd be at a nude bar watching a table dancer wearing the same outfit. That is possible. But to me, the difference between being single and being married, is the form of government. You see, when you're single, you are the dictator of your own life. I have complete power. I can give the order to fall asleep on the sofa with the TV on in the middle of the day, no-one can overrule me! When you're married, you're part of a vast decision-making body. Before anything gets done there are meetings. Committees have to study the situation. And this is if the marriage works. That's what's so painful about divorce you get impeached and you're not even the president!
Hey, is it my imagination, or do really good looking women walk a lot faster than everybody else?
We don't walk that fast...
No seriously...
Seriously, we don't.
The better looking they are, the faster they go! I mean, I see they out there on the street, they're zooming around, like a blur. Like they have a motor on their ass.
(Yelling to Jerry in the bedroom) Hey Jerry, come on, let's go. We're gonna miss the previews!
Hey, how are we gettin' to Scott Drake's party on Saturday night?
Oh, Drake's party, I forgot to buy a present.
I gotta buy a present now?
Of course you do, it's an engagement party.
It never ends, this present stuff! Engagement present! Then they get married, you gonna have to get them something for that! Then the baby, there's another present. Then the baby starts getting their presents. I don't even like Drake.
You don't like the Drake?
Hate the Drake.
I *love* the Drake.
How could you not like the Drake?
Who's the Drake?
"Who's the Drake"?
The Drake is good!
So listen, what are you gonna get him?
I haven't even met the fiancee! Whatever! (Leaves for washroom)
Elaine, look. I drew this triangle free-hand. It's a doodle. It's perfect!
So what? That's easy.
Easy?
Hi! Hey, have you gotten your present yet for the Drake?
Uh, no, no, not yet.
Do you like the Drake?
I *love* the Drake! I'm looking forward to meeting the Drakette!
I'm lukewarm about the Drakette.
(Looking at Jerry's doodle) That's a nice triangle...
It's Isosceles
Ooh, Isosceles. I love the name Isosceles. If I had a kid, I would name him Isosceles. Isosceles Kramer.
Hey, you know what, maybe we should all chip in for the gift.
The chip-in!
Hey, a pretty good idea, huh?
Yeah!
Yeah, the chip-in, defenitely!
You know what, let's go to that mall in Liberal(sp?) before we go to the party. We'll have to take your car, it's got the most room.
No, no! My car's not running.
What about your father's car?
No, no, no. Out of the question. I was over there today. He's got the good spot in front of the good building in the good neighbourhood. I know he's not gonna wanna move.
Are you serious?
You don't know what that spot means to him. Once he gets it, he doesn't go out for weeks.
How about this, you put your car in the good spot, that'll hold the good spot in front of the good building, and we can get the good car!
Good thinking!
Good to meet you!
So what are we gonna get him?
We could get him anything we wanted, we're chippin' in.
I like this area. I could live out here.
Yeah, we ought to all get a house and live together.
Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll tell you what chuckles, I give you permission to sublet my room right now.
Look at this. There's no spaces here. (to another car) Excuse me, are you gettin' out?
No!
Why don't you take a handicap spot...
You think?
No, no! We'll find a space. There's spaces in the other lot.
I don't want to walk that far.
What if a handicapped person needs it?
Oh, come on, they don't drive!
Yes, they do!
Have you ever seen a handicapped person pull into a space and park?
Well there's spaces there, they must drive!
Well they don't. If they could drive, they wouldn't be handicapped.
So if you can drive, you're not handicapped?
Look, we're not gonna be that long anyway... we have to get to the "party"!
I got news for you handicapped people, they don't even want to park there! They wanna be treated just like anybody else! That's why, those spaces are always empty.
He's right! It's the same thing with the femenists. You know, they want everything to be equal, everything! But when the check comes, where are they?
What does that mean?
Yeah! Alright, I'm pulling in.
Yeah, go ahead.
George!
Oh, come on, it's five minutes.
Make sure we don't forget where the car's parked.
Don't worry. We won't forget!
Do you believe the deal we got on this? A big screen TV? At that price?
What a sale, huh? And how about that store, delivering it tonight? We're gonna be swimming in 'thank you's...
What did I get the veggie burger for? You got a veggie burger, so I had to get the veggie burger, I'm allover crums...
No-one's gonna have a better gift than this big screen TV! Good for them, love the Drake!
Got to *love* the Drake!
Hey, what's going on over here?
Must have been an accident...
(to a woman) Hey, what's going on?
Some jerk parked in a handicap spot, so this woman in a wheelchair had to wheel up this incline, and half way up her batteries gave up, and she rolled backwards into the wall. Taken her to St. Elizabeth's...
Is she OK?
I don't know. We're just waiting here for the owner of this car to show up. May not get out alive! Thug! Taking up a handicap spot? He's gonna pay!
Son's of bitches! Good luck finding them... him... whatever. I'd like to stick around and get my hands on him myself, but I gotta take off.
How are we gonna get out of here? They'll kill us!
(to George) Are you happy now?
Who would think these people we're gonna be here?
I don't know...
What about the party? What about the Drake?
Screw the Drake!
I love the Drake!
Let's just take a bus back to the city.
Can't leave the car here!
Why not?
It's my father's car!
Let's smash it!
Yeah! Yeah!
Let's get out of here.
What are we gonna do? How are we gonna get out of here?
The thing is, even if we go back by the car, and there's nobody there, how do we know they're not all hiding, waiting for us?
Well, they have to give up some time, they can't stay out there all night?
What are we, John Dillinger? How did this get to be the crime of the century? It's not like we stuck a broomstick in her spokes and she went flying...
What I don't get is, just because the battery is dead, you think she'd be able to roll up the hill with her hands!
You'd think...
I mean, batteries have gone dead before, aren't they prepared for that?
Most of them don't even have batteries.
Must be one of those rich, spoiled handicapped people, who didn't want to do any work, and just wanted to sit in her wheelchair and take it easy.
Yeah...
Well, I'm sorry!
Our big screen TV is probably arriving right now...
How are we gonna get out of here? We need a plan!
I got it! (snaps his fingers) We give the keys to Elaine.
Me?
Yeah! You're a woman! Men don't hit a woman!
Oh, they won't?
Not if they don't know you...
I'm not going for this, Kramer should go! It was all his idea!
No chance in hell!
What if we created some sort of diversion? What if we all went by the car and started screaming "There he is, there's the guy that took the handicap spot!" And then, when they all run into the other direction, we'll jump in the car!
That's good, we'll give it a try...
That's good...
That doesn't work, we'll give 'em Kramer!
Huh?
(as George picks up a broken piece of his car) You know, a lot of these scratches will buff right out...
Eight years have I had this car. Not a scratch on it! Eight years!
A beautiful Mercury! I special-ordered that bench seat!
Dad, that other car cut us off! They had swastikas all over it... They were hurling racial epiphates at us... I could have been killed!
(to Frank) I told you not to give it to him!
(to George) You know, my insurance doesn't cover this? The whole thing is a total loss!
Frank, the important thing is, he didn't get hurt!
No it isn't!
So what are you doing now, Georgie?
I'm uh... writing a pilot for NBC...
Where the hell is my paper?
You're writing a pilot?
With his friend, Jerry Seinfeld... the comedian...
So what's it about?
Well, Jerry's car gets hit and the other driver doesn't have any insurance, so the judge
This is the same situation! Frank, maybe you ought to make him your butler!
Every time you're with that Kramer, something happens... He's a real trouble maker!
Nah, he didn't have anything to do with it...
He's all together crazy, that one! Jerry? I used to think was nice... I don't know what happened to him...
(to the Drake) So it was a good party, huh? Oh... you're welcome, you're welcome... (to Elaine) They loved the TV, *loved* it!
Oh, yeah...
(to the Drake) Oh, wait a second, I'll ask her.. that's a great idea. (To Elaine) Drake wants to know if we want to come out to Minneolis this afternoon, since we missed the partly last night, to maybe get something to eat?
Sure!
(to the Drake) Sure! ... Okay... Don't worry, I'm taking MY car! ... okay... okay, see you later... bye...
The Drake is great!
Hmm.. he's so nice! I'm really happy for them.
Yeah. Well, I don't know if I'm happy for them, I mean I'm glad they're happy, but, frankly, that doesn't do anything for me.
Yes?
It's me.
Come on up.
Hey. I just came from St. Elizabeth's.
St. Elizabeth's Hospital? Why?
Well, the handicapped woman? I went to see her.
You went to see her?
Yeah.
Wow, what happened?
I'm in love.
What?
Yeah, she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I love her Jerry, I really love her. I'm gonna ask her to marry me. She's got everything I've always wanted in another human being. Except for the walking.
Oh, what's the difference, you don't go out that much.
Ah, I'm glad you're here.
What?
Alright, now, we gotta go out. We gotta buy a wheelchair.
A wheelchair? What for?
Well, you know I went to the hospital today, and I saw the woman, you know, and the wheelchair is totalled, we gotta get her another one!
Doesn't she have collision?
George, I'm in love with her!
Well, my father works for the United Volunteers, maybe he can get her one.
No! She needs it now!
What about these two? Aren't they gonna chip in?
Well...
Hey, we told you not to park there!
Can't we just fix the old one?
Alright, alright. Fine George! Don't chip in! But some day, we're gonna be driving along, we're gonna look out the window, and see her crawling along 5th avenue! Is that what you want?
Alright, alright! We'll buy her a wheelchair! Wheelchairs, engagement presents.. IT NEVER ENDS!
This is out best model. The Cougar 9000. It's the Rolls Royce of wheelchairs. This is like... you're almost glad to be handicapped.
So now, what's this got?
Inductive joystick, dynamic braking, flip-up arms, it's fully loaded. I put Stephen Hawking in one of these two months ago, he's lovin' it! It's rated number one by Hospital Supply and Prosthetic Magazine.
How much?
6200
Do you have something a little more... less expensive?
Hey Drake! Hi Drake!
Hey Alison! Hey, there's the TV, Elaine, look at that!
My God this is fantastic! Tell me, were you guys just blown away or what?
Oh yeah, yeah... it's fantastic...
I am gonna make good use of this! I'm watching every superbowl here, every big fight....
Oh man, there is nothing like a really big TV, huh?
So where're we eatin'?
Well, actually... Jerry...
I'm *really* hungry!
... we just broke up...
When did this happen?
About 20 minutes ago... Hey, I am really sorry about this guys... whew!
(looking at the TV) Look at the picture on this thing...
Oh, cristal clear!
They know how to make 'em...
Are there any good Italian restaurants around here?
(through his sobbing) Gagliano's... that's pretty good...
Well... we should...
Get movin'...
Yeah... Hey, Drake, what ever happens, I am sure it'll be for the best.
Take it easy. Bye-Bye Alison!
Oh, the remote! Okay, I'm just gonna put it on top of the television...
Alright, this one is about 8 years old. Not a scratch on it, it was owned by some lady who only used it to go from the bathroom to the kitchen and to feed her cat.
But this'll get you around?
Oh sure, it just doesn't have any of the thrills of the Cougar.
Like what?
For example, your tremor-damping.
Now what's that?
It helps to control the direction regardless of the operator's tremors or spasticity.
Well, is it alright if I try it?
Hop in!
Oh yeah!
I tell ya...
When I see someone enjoying themselves like that, it reminds me why I got into this business in the first place.
How much?
How about $240?
We'll take it!
Drake gave her the TV?
He gave her all the gifts; he felt guilty.
Well, she can't keep it, it's not fair, that's *our* TV!
I know it is!
Boy, I am really starting to dislike the Drake!
I hate the Drake! Maybe the whole thing was a scam. Anybody can just get engaged and get presents and just keep them all. Maybe they're on their way to Chicago tomorrow and do the whole thing all over again.
They don't know anybody in Chicago.
Don't worry, they'll make friends fast with that nice TV.
Hey.
Hey, guess what? The Drake broke up.
I don't know about defraying.
Why?
We're not gettin' that TV.
What do you mean? The engagement is off, we get the TV back. That's business.
The Drakette took it.
She can't take it. It's not hers, it's theirs. Once there's no theirs there's no hers, it should be ours.
Well, she has it!
(upset) I *told* you the Drake was bad! I hate the Drake!
Maybe we should call her.
Well, who's gonna call?
You are.
What? Why is it me who always has to do these things?
Because that's your thing!
What? Calling people I hardly know, and demanding they return expensive gifts, that's my "thing"?
Yeah, that's your thing.
Alright, gimme the phone... it's my "thing"...
(to George) You know, I'm thinking about getting a yo-yo.
Really?
Yeah.
I could see that...
Hello?
Alison! Hi, this is Elaine...
I gave all the gifts to charity.
Oh, Okay... well thanks a lot... sorry again about you and the Drake...
I hate the Drake.
Everybody does. Bye-bye....
She gave it to charity.
Charity?!? That's apalling.
How could anybody be so selfish and inconsiderate!
Well, I gave her the wheelchair! You should have seen the look on her face. And then she told me, that the old wheelchair, that wasn't any good anyway! So you see George, the whole incident was a God blessing! Yeah!
You mean a blessing in disguise?
Yeah....
And I would also like to personally thank our gracious host Frank Costanza, who has earned the silver circle award and is our unanimous choice for the United Volunteer Representative of the Month!
Due to his tireless effort, he personally raised over $22,000. That's a lot of wheelchairs!
On behalf of the United Volunteers of Greater New York, we thank you!
Well... thank you very much!
Mr. Costanza?
Yes?
You're under arrest.
Under arrest? What for?
Reckless endangerment of public safety, and violation of traffic code 342-A.
What's that?
Parking in a handicap spot. Let's go...
George! George!
Your father got arrested? For what?
Parking in a handicap spot. Right in the middle of his United Volunteers meeting. When he got back, he chased after me with a baseball bat.
Ho-ly!
Between the car getting totalled, the towing charge and the fine, there's no way I can ever pay him back...
So what are you gonna do?
I agreed to become his butler.
What?
What's the matter?
It's over!
What's over?
Me and Lola....
The woman we bought the wheelchair for?
Yeah, she dumped me!
She dumped you?
She dumped me! She rolled right over me! Said I was a hipster dufus. Am I a hipster dufus?
(hesitatingly) ... no...
Said I'm not good looking enough for her. Not good looking! Jerry, look at me, look at my face, huh, am I beautiful? George, am I beautiful?
...you're very attractive...
yeah... she says she doesn't wanna see me again. Told me to drop dead!
Drop dead?
Boy, even I never heard that one...
She's pretty rough!
Yeesh-jip!
Well, we just blew 240 bucks on a wheelchair.
240 bucks?
Well, it was slightly used...
Used?
I don't think you did such a good job on these...
What!?
You're supposed to your face there! Do you see your face in there?
Yeah? ...oh really?...oh... how about that?... Right down a hill huh? Okay! Alight! Bye!
George, forget about the shoes. Want you to do something for me (scribbles something on a piece of paper). This handicapped woman had an accident. Somebody gave her a used wheelchair with defective brakes.
Sons of bitches!
Anyway, I want you to pick up this big screen TV, and deliver it to her.
Big screen TV?
Do you think you can handle it?
Yes?
Hi, we're from the United Volunteers, we've come to pick up the TV.
Oh great, it's right over there.
Ooh, it's a big one!
Who's got the receipt?
I do.
Will they give us cash?
That's their policy.
I hate this mall, there are never any spaces here...
Why don't you park in front of the hydrant?
What if there is a fire?
What are the chances of that?
night club]
To me, the whole concept of fear of success is proof that we are definitely scraping the bottom of the fear barrel. Are we gonna have to have AA-type meetings for these people? They'll go "Hi, my name is Bill, and the one thing I'm worried about is to have a stereo and a cream-colored couch." According to most studies, people's number-one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. *Death* is number two! Now, this means to the average person, if you have to go to a funeral, you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy.
Jerry's]
Why can't I play Kramer?
Look we've been through this already. You're not an actor!
Neither are you.
I know. So why do we need two people in the show that can't act?
Oh come on Jerry. How hard is it to act. You say something, I'll pretend it's funny.
My grandmother's in the hospital.
Ha ha ha. Your grandmother's in the hospital!
This is real believable.
What you didn't think I was really laughing?
It stinks.
Let me see you do it.
Say something funny.
Alright. I've never been to Mars but I imagine it's quite lovely.
Ah..........
Mine was better than that! Come on look. (starts to laugh again, Jerry too)
Why are two pretending to be laughing?
We're acting. (they stop laughing)
Oh, real good. (George makes a face like you stink) Any word from NBC?
No.
I don't understand. They're supposed to be casting this week. Something's wrong. Maybe they're not doing it.
(to Jerry) Well at least let me audition.
(to George) He wants to play Kramer in the Pilot.
(to George) Yeah!
Out of the question.
Oughh!
(to Jerry) How could we not hear anything? What's with this Russel? What's he doing? (Jerry raises his arms and shoulders like he doesn't know)
Peter McManus cafe, an Italian restaurant]
I really appreciate you coming.
Oh, that's O.K. I don't have much time though. So...
All right, first of all, I want to apologize for all the phone calls. It's just--It's just-- (awkward pause) I don't understand, we went out once...
That was two months ago.
Yes I know. I just-- I can't get you out of my mind. Ever since that-- that day in the restaurant when we met... (we see a flashback from 'The Shoes' of Elaine showing her cleavage and asking Russell for his Ketchup secret)
Russell, you are the president of NBC. You can have any woman you want. (picks up the bowl of munchies on the table)
But I want you.
God I hate these mixtures. Why don't they just put pretzels on the table. Even peanuts would be good, but I don't know how eats these cheesy things (she does).
Is it something I said... or did?
Um... Look Russell... You're a very sweet guy. But I got to be honest with you. I don't like television... and that's your world. That's your life. I mean maybe if you were in... I don't know... Greenpeace or something, that would be different, but network television... I mean, come on, Russell, you're part of the problem.
Oh Elaine, we're doing some really very interesting things right now. We've got some very exciting pilots for next season. We have one with a bright young comedian, Jerry Seinfeld.
Oh yeah, oh yeah. I've heard of him. He's that "Did you ever notice this? Did you ever notice that?" guy.
Yeah. Anyway it's a ground breaking show.
Really? What is it about?
(a little more enthusiast) Well, really, it's very unusual. It's about nothing.
(surprised) What do you mean it's about nothing?
(starts doing George at the first meeting with NBC in 'The Pitch') For example, what did you do today?
Um, I got up. Um, I went to work. Then I came here.
There's a show. that's a show.
Russell, see, I'm really not interested in this stuff and I do have to go to work (she gets up). So...
(stops doing George, he's down again) Elaine, When--when--when are we gonna see each other again.
I'm sorry Russell. I'm sorry O.K.? Bye-bye. (Russell, still sitting watches her leaving).
Jerry's]
Hello? Yeah he's here. (to Kramer) Hey! It's for you.
He's getting phone calls here now? (he's standing near the counter and eating chips out of a big bag)
(to George) Again with the sweat pants?
What? I'm comfortable.
You know the message you're sending out to the world with these sweat pants? You're telling the world "I give up. I can't compete in normal society. I'm miserable, so I might as well be comfortable." (George is baffled)
(to the phone) Hold on a second I got another call. Hello? Yeah, he'll call you back. (Jerry and George look at each other)
(to Kramer) Who is it?
That's NBC.
NBC!?! Give me the phone!
I'm in the middle of a conversation here.
Get off the phone!
(to the phone) Look, I'll call you back. (hangs up)
You know I'm waiting to hear from them. Who was it?
Russell Dalrimple's secretary.
All right. Now you're doing something to help me. (to the phone) Hello yeah it's Jerry Seinfeld returning the call. Uh-huh.. O.K. great thanks a lot. (hangs up)(to George) Casting tomorrow at NBC. 400. We're in business baby, the pilot's on. You're gonna successful. (George looks disappointed)
Dana's office]
What if the pilot gets picked up and it becomes a series?
That'd be wonderful George, you'll be rich and successful.
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm worried about. God would never let me be successful. He'd kill me first. He'd never let me be happy.
I thought you didn't believe in God?
I do for the bad things.
Do you hear what you're saying? God isn't out to get you George. What... What is that on your lip?
What?
It's like a discoloration. It's white.
(gets up and picks a mirror) Yes. Yes, it's white. Why it's white.
You'd better get that checked out.
Better get that checked out?
I would.
What kind of a therapist are you? I'm telling I'm scared that something terrible is gonna happen to me, right away you start looking for tumors?
I'm trying to help you.
What are you like a sadist? No matter how bad somebody feels, you can make 'em feel worse. I bet you're rooting for a tumor. (pointing to her)
I think you'd better go.
Oh I'm going baby! I'm going! (he leaves)
Jerry and George in a cab at a light]
Where?
Right here. (showing his lip)
Get out of here, it's nothing. (Jerry knows George is hypochondriac. See 'The Heart Attack')
(to the cab driver) Excuse me, do you see anything on my lip here?
Yeah, it's like a discoloration.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, it's all white.
(to Jerry) It's all white Jerry! It's all white!
Would you stop?
I would get that checked out if I were you.
Again with the checked out. I'm not going to the doctor. If I don't to the doctor, then nothing will happen to me. If I go he might find something.
If you go, maybe they'll catch it in time.
Catch what in time?
Whatever it is.
You think it's something?
Ah! I hate these bums with their filthy rags. No no no, I don't want it, get away, get away from my car (he starts his wipers)
(to George) You know these squeegee-- Oh my God! It's crazy Joe Devola.
(through the opened window's cab) Good luck on the pilot Jerry. (the cab pulls away)
NBC]
(to George) Yeah I think I see it. It's like a white discoloration.
(to Jay) What do you think it is?
It's like a... white discoloration. (we understand now why a sitcom needs so many producers)
O.K. guys, are we ready to start?
Yeah, where is Russell? I thought he was gonna be here.
Oh you know I don't know. I saw him in the hall this morning, I said hello to him. He walked right past me.
He must be worried about the fall schedule.
Ah, it's a real bear.
Yeah. So what's going on? We're gonna shoot the pilot and then it's gonna be on TV the following week?
Yeah. Right.
This is Mark Matts. He'll be auditioning for the role of George. (the guy looks very cool and casual, and has a lot of hair)
Hey how you doing?
(thinking) They've gotta be kidding.
(thinking) This guy's perfect.
O.K. Let's read this. I'll be reading Jerry's part.
Anyone call for Vandelay Industries? (George is the only one in the room to find Mark funny)
No. Why?
Listen to me. I told the unemployment office I was close to a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when you answer the phone now, you've got to say "Vandelay Industries".
I'm Vandelay Industries?
Right.
What is that?
You're in latex.
What do I do with latex?
I don't know, you manufacture it.
This is Michael Barth. Another George. (he's in sweat pants, bald, with glasses)
Hi Michael. How you doing?
Everything all right?
I just came from the podiatrist. I have a mole on my foot. I've got a little gangrene, they're probably gonna have to amputate. (everyone laugh except George)
Any questions?
Yeah. What are we looking at here? Is this guy like a real loser?
No, not a loser!
Let's start with the second scene. You have it here?
A man gave me a, you know, massage. (everyone laugh except George)
So?
Well, he-- he had his hands, you know, and uh, he was, huh, ...
He was what?
He was you know... he was touching and rubbing. (loud laughter)
That's a massage.
I think it moved.
This is Melissa Shannon.
Hi.
Hi. How you doing.
Melissa is reading for Elaine.
It's like a bald convention out there! (she saw George) Sorry. I, uh, made a faux pas.
No you didn't. He knows he's bald.
So how about that guy wearing sweat pants? I mean did he do that for the part or does he walk around like that? (Jerry approves with a nod, George drops his notepad on the coffee table)
O.K. Shall we start? (Melissa and the casting director sit down)
(getting up) Uh, you know what? I'll read with her.
Oh, great.
Alright, want to start?
Yeah.
O.K.
Ahem. What was that look?
What look?
That look you just gave me?
I gave a look?
Yes.
Thank you! Thank you very much. (Jerry and Melissa stop and look at George)
Let's see some more Kramers.
Hi. How you doing?
(to Jerry and very seriously) How you doing?
(smiling and surprised at the way Tom is talking) Good.
What is this about?
(standing) Levels.
Levels?
Yeah. I'm getting rid of all, all my furniture. All of it! I'm building... levels... with steps... completely carpeted... (making the gesture of carpeting steps) with pillows. (everyone laugh. He sits down) Like Ancient Egypt.
I don't know how you're gonna be comfortable like that?
Oh! I'll be comfortable. (laughter, applause. He gets up, goes to the coffee table)
Very nice
Very good
Very nice Tom, that was terrific.
May I? (pointing the box of raisins)
Sure. Thank you for coming in. (Tom eats some raisins)
(to George) It was a wonderful reading.
Yeah. Really.
Well, bye.
Take care. Take it easy. (Tom leaves with the casting director)
Now, I thought he was really good, very funny.
Yeah, I liked him.
What happened to the raisins?
Yeah, there was a box of raisins there!
Did he just steal the raisins?
You think he stole them?
(enters with the real Kramer) This is Martin Van Nostrand.
(to Kramer) What are you doing here?
You two know each other?
Wait a minute, I know you. You're the guy from the Calvin Klein underwear ads.
That's true.
(acting very bad) I saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Doughnuts again, but this time, I went in. (pause, stops acting) Oh! Uh, where's the bathroom?
I think if you go down the hall, it's on the right at the very end.
Yeah. Be right back. (Kramer leaves)
"Sorry buddy, full house." We then see Kramer outside leaving the building and running across the street to a restaurant "Sorry, customers only" ...running into a movie theater "Hey you need a ticket!" ...running through the park...)
Monk's]
So who's playing Elaine?
Oh, don't worry about it. Very talented, very takented young actress.
Really?
Yes.
Who is it?
She's an eskimo, actually.
Oh, my God (not in the mood to be kidding)
She came down from Juno by sleigh, she was in the Iditarod. Got to the finish line, just kept going. She's got the dogs with her in the hotel room.
Listen, was Russell at the casting?
No, he didn't show up.
You know, I'm a little bit worried about him. I don't understand. We had one date two months ago. Am I that charming and beautiful?
No. No you're not.
Why do I keep setting you up?
I don't know.
(to the waitress) Could we get a little more? (she doesn't listen and walks away) Aghh... You know ever since this new owner took over, the service here is *really* slow.
Yeah. Have you noticed anything else that's different since the new management?
Mmm. They're putting a little lemon in the tuna. I love that.
Beside that. Look at the waitresses.
Yeah? (we see that all the waitresses have big breasts)
What physical characteristic would you say is common to all of them?
Ah...
I mean look at this. Every waitress working here has the same proportions. Wouldn't you say?
Yes, I would say.
What's going on here. How is that possible?
Do you think it's a coincidence?
No. I haven't seen four women like this together outside of a Russ Meyer film.
(to the waitress) Hi. Excuse me. Who does all the hiring waitresses here?
He does. (pointing to the manager, Mr. Visaki) In fact we're looking for another girl if you know anyone. (she walks away)
You know what? That's discriminatory. That is unfair. Why should these women have all the advantages? It's not enough they get all the attention from men, they have to get all the waitress jobs, too?
Hey that's life. Good-looking men have the same advantages. You don't see any handsome homeless.
doctor's clinic]
You see, It's right here. It's all white...
Oh yeah. Yeah. I've never seen this before.
You've never seen this before?
I'm gonna have to take a biopsy on that. (George grabs the doctor's arm)
(dramatically) A what?
A biopsy.
A biopsy?
Yeah.
Cancer? Is it cancer? Do I have cancer?
Well I don't know what it is.
Jerry's]
A biopsy!
What did he say?
He said he didn't know what it was.
Alright. So?
When I asked him if it was cancer, he didn't give me a "get outta here". That's what I wanted to hear "Cancer? Get outta here?"
Well, maybe he doesn't have a "get outta here" kind of personality.
How could you be a doctor and not say "get outta here"? It should be part of the training at medical school "Cancer? Get outta here!" "Go home! What are you crazy? It's a little test. It's nothing. You're a real nut. You know that?" (Jerry gives him half of his sandwich to hopefully shut him up) I told you that God would never let me be successful. I never should've written that pilot. Now the show will be a big hit, we'll make millions of dollars, and I'll be dead. Dead Jerry. Because of this. (showing his lip)
Can't you at least die with a little dignity?
No I can't. I can't die with dignity. I have no dignity. I want to be the one person who doesn't die with dignity. I live my whole life in shame. Why should I die with dignity?
Hey. What happened to you yesterday?
I got mugged.
You got mugged?
Mugged?
Well, I wouldn't have minded it so much but I was running home to go to the bathroom.
Why didn't you use the bathroom in the building?
It was full. I tried a few other places, you know, but that didn't work. I mean it was an emergency Jerrry. I was really percolating... So I decided to run home through the park and then these two guys they stopped me and...
Yeah?
It's me.
Come on up.
But now I have a big problem, buddy.
What is it?
Well, I waited so long I-- I missed my chance.
You didn't go?
No. And now I can't get it back.
The % thing to do is just not think about it.
How could you not think about it?
Hey.
(mumbles and leaves)
What's the matter with him?
He's a little backed up.
Oh...
Elaine.
So I spoke to some of my sisters about that coffee shop.
Oh, the sisters (he sits at the table)
(to Jerry) Have you seen the waitresses in there lately? I never had so much coffee in my life.
So we decided I should go over there and apply for a job myself.
Apply for a job? What for?
Because, it's discriminatory (she comes back wearing one of Jerry's shirts, untucked)
It's a coincidence.
This is what you gonna wear?
Yeah.
You're not gonna get the job.
Exactly.
(to the phone) Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah I guess we could do that. At what time? All right. I'll see you there. O.K., bye. (hangs up)
Who was it?
TV Elaine. She wants to get together and talk about the part.
What about the dogs?
They're having sex in the hotel room.
Peter McManus cafe, same table as earlier]
Sandi Robbins)
So, the Elaine character is based on someone you know.
Yes.
And she's really your ex-girlfriend?
Uh, Huh, yeah.
I want to get to know her from the inside. What is she like? Tell me about her.
Well, she's fascinated with Greenland. She enjoys teasing animals, banlon, and seeing people running for their lives. She loves throwing garbage out the window, yet she's extremely dainty.
How would she eat a hamburger?
With her hands.
What about pasta?
Also with her hands.
Seriously... I want to experience everything she's experienced.
Everything?
Everything.
All right she cuts her pasta with a knife.
That's good. What's her favorite movie?
Shaft.
You got to get me a picture. What about sex?
She likes talking during sex.
Oh... dirty talking?
No. Just chitchat, movies, current events, regular stuff. You know Sandi-- (looking at his watch)
Elaine.
What?
Call me Elaine.
All right. Elaine.
How does Elaine kiss?
Well--
Does she kiss... like this? (she kisses Jerry)
Actually she has a thing where she spirals her tongue around, it's like--
Like this? (kisses again but with the spiral)
I think you got it.
Monk's]
I like to eat spaghetti with just a fork. Because I can keep the strands long, and I can slurp it out to my mouth. Like this look. (faking to slurp spaghetti) Now sex, I like the bottom. Let them do all the work. You should be writing this stuff down... (waitress comes to take the order) Bran lakes...100%. I got a big problem.
I'll have a hamburger. That's it.
Yeah, that's good. Oh, now I like to play golf.
This stuff doesn't matter to me. See, I'm gonna do the character like me, not like you.
You gotta play him like me. I'm Kramer.
I'm Kramer.
Whoa, I'm Kramer.
(foreign accent) What can I do for you? Would you like a table.
No, I'd like to apply for a waitress job.
(looks Elaine up and down) Have you ever waited on tables before.
Oh yeah. I've been a professional waitress for the last 10 years. I've worked all over the city. These, uh, are my references. I'm sure you'll find that I'm more than qualified.
I don't think I need anyone else right now.
You're in big trouble mister. And I mean trouble with a capital 'T'. (she leaves)
What? What did I do?
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Office]
Anyway there's at least four of them, and they're all huge. And one is bigger than the next. It's like a Russ Meyer movie.
Who's Russ Meyer?
Oh, he's this guy who made these terrible movies in the 70's with these kinds of women. He's obsessed. He's obsessed with breasts. That's hard to say.
Anyway, go on.
Um... Well, there's not really much more to tell. He was looking for waitresses, and I went in to apply for the job. And, he looked me up and down and he rejected me.
(to a guy in the hall at the water cooler machine) Paul. Come in for a second. I want you to listen to this.
(to Elaine) Hi.
Hi.
Paul, woman here claims there's a restaurant on the West side that's only hiring large-breasted women.
(to Elaine) Really?
NBC, pilot's set]
What do you mean made up?
It's made up. Haagen-Dazs is made up. It's not Danish.
You're crazy.
No I'm not. (to Michael) George. Is Haagen-Dazs Danish?
What do you mean Danish?
(to the guy next to him) This guy stinks. (speaking of Michael)
Danish. Is it from Denmark?
No, they make it in New Jersey. It's just a Danishy name.
I can't believe that. They fooled *me* Jerry.
(to Jay) Boy, talk about a show about nothing. (Jay, the integral producer, smiles stupidly)
Uh, excuse me. (stopping them from rehearsing) Excuse me. (he walks to the guy's in charge of yelling "take #!") This--This is not right. May I? (the guy looks at George with a bothered face. George then walks up to Tom and takes him away from Jerry and Michael to talk to him in private)(to Tom) You see, you're going "They fooled *me* Jerry!" (George shakes his head with disapproval) You wanna hit 'fooled' more "They *fooled* me Jerry!". You see the difference?
I'm not gonna say it like that.
Just a suggestion. (chuckles and walks back to the yelling guy)
(with the same bothered face and while he's looking at George) All right everybody, take a five.
(very casual and raising his hand in the air) Yep. That's five!
George? (walks away to talk privately. George, still casual, taps on Jerry's shoulder) I don't have a lot of experience with this acting stuff. But from what I can gather, they're a little touchy about being told how to say the lines.
Why is that?
I don't know, but they don't seem to like it. By the way how am I doing?
Oh, you're fine... you're fine. (looking at Tom in the back and then quieter to Jerry) So you think this guy playing Kramer took the raisins?
Why would he steal a box of raisins?
Yeah, it's bizarre. (they both look around them suspiciously)
(to Jay about Russell) What's with him? (to Russell) Russell? (louder) Russell?
What?
You O.K.?
Yeah. No, uh, I was just thinking of something. I'll be back in a second. (he gets up and leaves)
What's the matter?
Nothing.
You're acting weird. Is anything wrong?
No.
Are you breaking up with me?
Are we going out?
You're breaking up with me, aren't you? (almost crying)
Do you want me to break up with you?
If that's what you want.
I don't even know what you're talking about.
Fine. Break up with me.
All right. We're broken up.
(little pause) Can we still be friends? (Jerry raises his head, staring ahead and wondering what's going on)
Remember when you came to audition for us?
Yeah.
There was a box of raisins on the coffee table. Did you, by any chance, take them with you when left?
What are you talking about?
Well we were all eating the raisins. And I remember you--you were eating some of the raisins. And then you left, and the raisins were gone. And I was just wondering if, you know (chuckles), maybe you took them with you.
Are you accusing me of stealing the raisins?
Oh, no, no--
(angry) Why would I steal a box of raisins!?
No you wouldn't. Nobody would. It's just that... they were missing, and... well I'm just inquiring. (chuckles nervously)
Let me give you a word of advice. O.K.? I want you to stay away from me. I don't wanna talk to you, and I don't wanna hear anymore of your stupid little notes and suggestions. I don't like you. So if you got any other problems whether it's raisins, prunes, figs, or any other dried fruit, just keep it to yourself and stay out of my way, O.K.?
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. All right. I don't think we're gonna have any problem with that. (chuckles nervously) Good talking to you Tom. Really.
(nervously, almost desperately) Elaine. Elaine. What do you want? What can I do? Is it my job? Is that what it is? Elaine I can't go on like this. Will you call me? Would you call me? Well, why? All right. May I call you? Elaine? Elaine? (she hung up. An employee walks by, bumps into Russell and spills coffee accidentally on him)
Excuse me Mr. Dalrimple. I am so sorry.
All right. All right. What's your name?
David Richardson.
Get out! You're fired!
But Mr. Dalrimple--
Don't talk back to me. Didn't you hear what I say? Get out! You want me to call the cops? I make and break little worms like you every day. Do you know how much money I make? Do you have any idea! Do you know where I live? I can have any woman in this city that I want. Any one. Now, GET OUT! (David leaves. Everyone on the set is looking at Russell) What are you all looking at? Go back to work! BACK! NOW! (they do, Russell leaves)
Jerry's]
The doc called and said the lab's backed up and now I'm not gonna get the results for another two days.
Ah! You're fine. There's nothing wrong with you. I'm the one who's dying.
What do you mean?
Because I can't act! I stink! I don't what I'm doing!
Come on you're... uh... you're fine.
This show's gonna ruin my entire career. I don't know how I got involved in this.
What about me? I was a total failure. Everything was fine. Now this thing's gonna be a success and God's gonna give me a terminal disease.
This actress playing Elaine, she's out of her mind.
The guy playing Kramer threatened me.
Why?
'cause I asked him about the raisins.
You mentioned the raisins.
Oh yeah.
Did he take 'em?
I don't know.
Well if he didn't take 'em, what happened to 'em?
That's what I'm trying to find out.
Hey.
Hey.
Any luck?
No. No, nothing. I got no... peristalsis.
What about bran?
I tried bran-- 40%, 50% 100%. The bran isn't working for me.
Well my friend, (Jerry puts his hand on Kramer's shoulder) it may be time to consider the dreaded apparatus.
Pfft! Hold it right there. If you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting, you're wasting your time. I am not Jerry, under any circumstances, doing any inserting in that area.
Oh, it's not that bad!
Yes it is.
Well it's all taken care of. I filed a report. An investigation is underway.
(to Elaine) So, you going to the taping tomorrow night?
No. I don't think I should go. I really don't wanna bump into Russell. He called me the other day. He won't quit.
Oh, come on you gotta go! He's harmless. He's got a little crush on you.
Jerry, this is not a crush. This is a complete fixation. he makes me very uncomfortable.
We need you there!
(to Kramer) Hey are you gonna go?
No. No. I'm gonna stay home. I want to be close to my home base in case there's any news from the front. (he leaves)
NBC, pilot's set, the taping]
(to her hairdresser) No! Pick it up more in the front! It's got to be higher! Higher! Make a wall! A wall!
Sandi, are you in wardrobe? Sandi?
Try Elaine.
Elaine?
Yes?
Elaine? It's me-- Wilton Marshall. Remember? Camp Tioga-- 1978? Remember?
Oh, right.
Wow! You know you haven't changed a bit.
I can't remember my lines!!!
Just relax, you'll be fine.
I can't relax. I don't know what line! I don't know any of 'em!
You're just like George. George'd do the same thing. You're just like him. It's amazing!
Help me Jerry! Help me!
(to Stu) Where is Russell?
You know I don't know. I thought he was coming. I assumed he wouldn't miss it.
He hasn't been well.
(to Rita) Can I tell you something in confidence? I think it's a woman.
How pathetic.
This is George Costanza, I'm calling for my test results. Negative? Oh, my God. WHY! WHY! WHY? What? What? Negative is good? Oh, yes of course! How stupid of me. Thank you. Thank you very much. (he hangs up)
(he walks casually to Tom, and taps his arm) Listen. I know we've had our problems in the past, but we got a show to do tonight. Time to pull together as a team. Life's too short. I say, let's let bygones be bygones. If you took the raisins, if you didn't take the raisins-- They weren't even my raisins. I was just curious because it seems like a strange to do to walk into a room, audition, and to walk out with a box of raisins. Anyway, whatever. If you ever want to tell me about it, the door to my office is always opened. In the event that I get an office. You'll come in, we'll talk about the raisins. We'll have a nice laugh.
How would you like it if I just pulled your heart out of your chest right now, and shoved it down your throat?
Are you ready to meet our cast? (crowd applause) All right.
Good evening, folks. How you doing? (small reaction from the crowd) Well, you sound like a great crowd. We have a show we're gonna put on for you tonight. It's a new TV show. It's what they call a pilot. And we hope it becomes a series. It's called 'Jerry', and I'm playing Jerry--
(getting up then shouting) SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS! (he jumps over a balcony and on the stage. The crowd is yelling)
Jerry's]
Sic semper tyrannis? What is that, Latin?
Yeah, it's what John Wilkes Booth yelled out when he shot Lincoln.
Really? What does it mean?
It means "Death to tyrants".
I can see that.
See, now this is exciting! This is exciting! Did I miss anything already?
No, it starts in five minutes. You were there at the taping, what's the big deal?
Nah, now it's on TV. It's different. I told everybody I know to watch it.
Yeah, me too.
Hey, what about Russell? Did you hear from him?
No.
Strange. Even not showing up at the taping...
Hey, pistol-packin mama, you swing that gal around, Allemande left with the old gray hag, around and around you go. Yee-ha!!
Well, well, well.
Congratulations.
Well, thank you.
You went for the big "E".
Wet and wild.
All right. Come on sit down. It's about to start.
Oh, yes.
Hey, what's this? Look. A wallet.
A wallet? Let me see that.
Here.
Ah, man! It's my father's wallet! The one he thought they stole at the doctor's office that time.
Shh! This is it!
How do you like that?



"Created by Jerry Seinfeld and George Costanza".
Bravo!
You hurt me.
Hey.
Hey George.
New sneakers?
Yeah.
What do you need new sneakers for?
I like sneakers.
How do you make a decision which one to wear? I'd go crazy if I have to decide which sneakers to wear every day.
Nah, you're crazy anyway.
(to each other while they recognize one of George's behaviors in Michael) George!
What kind of stupid show is this? Hey! It's that idiot that took all my records! (the houskeeper starts laughing)
John, what are you doing? Come back to bed.
(with a Boston accent) This show looks interesting. Isn't he that Seinfeld fellow you went out with?
Ooh, he's horrible! Horrible!
Nevertheless...
Ah, that Jerry's a funny guy. Huh? Got to love the Sein!
Hate the Sein! (while she adjusts the tiny antenna)
I can't believe you liked him.
I thought he was dark and disturbed.
Real perceptive.
This is a piece of crap!
Donald, you used to like him.
What a sellout! Give me that remote!
No, Donald.
Come on Jerry, the commercials almost over.
All right.
You know Jerry I really like this guy who's playing the butler.
Oh yeah. He's good. You know he's John Ritter's cousin.
Really?
Yeah.
Hello, Charles.
Hello. So, where do you want me to start today?
Why don't you start in the bedroom?
(to himself, upset) Start in the bedroom...
Hey.
Hey. The butler's here.
He is? Listen. When he's finished, send him over to my house.
I'm not sending him to your house.
Why not?
Because the judge decreed he'd become my butler, not my friend's butler.
Jerry, he is your butler. You can give him any order you want. That's what butlers do.
But I don't want to.
Jerry, my house is a pigsty, come on.
Yeah?
(from the buzzer's speaker) It's Elaine.
Come on up.
I need more Pledge.
More Pledge! I just bought two cans last week and I don't even have any wood in the house!
Well, it goes fast.
(to Charles, very friendly) Hello.
Hello. (he goes back in the bedroom)
What's all this about?
We had a date.
You had a date? You went out with my butler? Who said you could go out with my butler?
Why do I need your permission?
Because he's my butler!
That's terrific!
How could anyone not like him?
I like his style. He has a sort of casual elegance.
But he picks his nose.
Nevertheless...
He's a member of our health club. Isn't he?
Yeah...
You know that Kim Novak has some big breasts?
Ever notice a lot of butlers are named Jeeves?
You know I think when you name a baby Jeeves, you've pretty much mapped out his future, wouldn't you say? Not much chance is gonna be a hitman I think after that. (with a British accent) "Terribly sorry Sir, but I'm going to have to whack you".
back to Jerry's]
(applauding and shaking hands) Wooh! Yeah!
Wow! That was great! That show was so funny. It was really funny. I'm not just saying that cause I know you. Honestly.
Let's go out and celebrate! (they all get up)
That was so good.
Come on let's eat something. (phone rings)
You know what I think this thing is gonna get picked up George. You guys are gonna be rich!
Do you really think so?
Oh yeah.
And God didn't kill me.
(to the phone) Hello?
Hi Jerry, this is Rita Kierson.
Oh, hi Rita.
I'm calling to let you know that Russell Dalrimple is no longer with this network.
Oh, my God. Did he get fired?
To be honest with you. Nobody really knows. He seems to have disappeared.
Russell's disappeared?
In any event, I've been made the new president of NBC. As you may or may not know, Russell and I did not see eye to eye on many, many projects. And as my first order of business, I'm, uh, passing on your show.
You're passing already? But the show just ended two minutes ago!
Well, I just got the job. Goodbye, Jerry.
Yeah, see ya. (he hangs up)
What-- What are you looking at me for?
It was you!
What did I do?
Do you realize his obsession with you cost us a TV series?
I didn't know that he'd fall for me and I'd drive him insane. I mean, you know, that's not my fault.
Yes it is! You're very charming!
I can't believe this? What happened to him? Where the hell is he?
No one knows.
Greenpeace raft on the ocean, following a whaler]
She works for Pendant Publishing. She's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. You know, I used to work for NBC, but when I go back to her this time, she'll respect me.
You'd better get down. They might start firing soon. (harpoon fires)
Monk's]
Hey look at this. What is going on here?
Well, well, well.
Nothing has changed. How did this happen? (she sees the two guys of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission at a table) Ah, these are the two guys I talked to at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Hey! What are you two guys doing here? I thought you were gonna do something about this. Now you're eating here?
Oh no. That's why we're here. We're checking things out.
Yeah, we're checking it out.
(to Paul) You're checking it out?
(to Fred and Paul) See you back at the office, guys.
Fred, Paul, lunch and dinner? Boy, you guys ought to move in. How about a piece of pie on me? Sophia! Take care of these fellows.
(to the manager) Hey! Come here a second. I want you to know something. You are not gonna get away with this!
Get away with what?
Ah, "with what?" You know what. With the waitresses. How they're all... alike.
Of course they're alike. They're my daughters.
(embarrassed, but smiling) Oh, your daughters.
You must be very proud Mr. Visaki. (shaking his hand) And may I say sir they're lovely girls, absolutely lovely girls. It's nice to see such fine upstanding women in gainful employment, Mr. Visaki.
Oh, here's a table for you.
A table right here.
Peggy!
Peggy! (they all sit) His daughter Peggy. Peggy's coming over to serve.
What a family!
My daughter Peggy.
Ah! Peggy. Good to see you.
Hi Peggy.
Thank you very much. (Peggy leaves the menus and walks away) So guess what I got do tomorrow?
What?
Start looking for a job.
You know what you ought to do George? You should work for Greenpeace. You those people they attack the whalers out on the open sea.
Are you crazy? You take your life in your hands with those nuts.
Greenpeace raft]
Keep fighting matey! Get your head above the water! I've got you matey! I've got you! Matey! (he loses the rope) I'll remember her name! Elaine Benes! I'll write to her. I'll tell her all about you and what you did out here! Goodbye, matey! Goddbye!
Monk's]
So, what's her name?
Karen.
Is she nice?
Great.
So you like her?
I think so.
You don't know?
I can't tell anymore.
Well do you feel anything?
Feel? What's that?
All right, let me ask you this when she comes over, you're cleaning up a lot?
Yeah.
You're just straightening up or you're cleaning?
Cleaning
You do the tub?
Yeah.
On your knees, Ajax, hands scrubbin', the whole deal?
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, I think you're in love!
Tub is love?
Tub is love.
Hah.
So there you are. You've got a nice girl and a clean apartment.
Yep. There's one liiiittle problem.
Sexual?
Yeeeaaah. (Jerry and George lean in to make their conversation a little more private) Well..... I've never really felt confident in uh..... one particular aspect.
Below the equator?
Yeah.
Nobody does. You know, nobody knows what to do. You just close your eyes and you hope for the best. I really think they're happy if you just make an effort.
I-I don't know. Last time I got the tap.
You got the tap?
You know, you're going along, you think everything's all right and all of a sudden you get that tap. (George taps his own shoulder). You know it's like pfffff (whistling sound), all right that's enough, you're through.
The tap is tough.
It's like the manager coming out and asking you for the ball.
Well maybe she just wanted to move on to other business.
No, no, this wasn't moving on. I got the hook. I wish I could get a lesson in that.
It's a very complicated area.
You can go crazy trying to figure that place out.
It's a haaazy mystery.
Anyway, I think everything else is okay. Unless of course she's faking.
Who's faking?
Nothing.
Faking what?
Nobody's faking.
Ah! Orgasm?
She's not faking!
How do you know?
I know. I can tell. It's one of my powers. Why, did you ever fake?
Of course.
Really?
You faked?
On occasion.
And the guy never knows?
No.
How can he not know that?
Because I was gooood.
I guess after that many beers he's probably a little groggy anyway.
You didn't know.
What?
You didn't know.
Are you saying...
I think I'll have a piece of cake.
With me?
Well...
You faked with me?
Ye.
You faked with me?
Yeass.
No.
Yeass.
You faked it?
I faked it.
That whole thing, the whole production, it was all an act?
Not bad huh?
What about the breathing, the panting, the moaning, the screaming?
(points in the air as is to point out each things Jerry asked) Fake, fake, fake, fake.
I'm stunned, I'm shocked! How many times did you do this?
Uuuhm, all the time.
All the time?!
We got a chocolate malt in here!
But I'm so good.
I'm sure you are.
Jerry, listen, it wasn't you. I just didn't have 'em back then.
She faked.
Maybe they've all been faking.
I'm sure they're not.
Maybe Karen is faking.
Jerry's apartment]
She was probably joking.
No no, it was no joke.
She didn't have any?
No. None.
(raising hand) She faked 'em all.
(raising hand) Faked 'em all.
Well so she faked 'em, so what?
The woman had an orgasm under false pretences. That's sexual perjury.
You know I heard her screaming from my apartment? She woke me up a few times.
How did she do it? She's like Meryl Streep this woman. And I had to work the equipment. I'm not unskilled, I'm in the union. If she'd at least told me, maybe I could have done something about it.
Yeah I could have helped you out.
What could you have done?
I could have given you some pointers. I know how to press those buttons buddy.
I'm feeling very inadequate about the whole thing.
Aaaaah.
Don't aaaaah! I'm supposed to do something with her later? I don't even think I wanna see her.
Giddy-up.
Hello... Oh hello Elaine.
So we're having dinner tonight?
I don't know, I'm not really in the mood.
Why? What's wrong? You're not still thinking about this afternoon are you?
What, the grilled cheese? Naaah, they always burn the toast.
Nooo, the other thing.
Oooh that. Well...
Oh come on, Jerry. Making to much of a big deal about it.
Yeah I guess. So you wanna meet at that place at seven thirty?
Okay.
All right.
All right, see you later.
Bye.
Bye.
Elaine's office]
Rene, can you come here a second? Let me ask you something Ummm, have you ever... you know... faked it?
Yeah, sometimes.
Really, like when?
Like if we went to a Broadway show, if we had really good seats. (Elaine is sitting there, jaw opened shaking her head yes) Well you know, if it's enough all ready and I just wanna get some sleep.
Jerry's apartment]
I really don't feel like seeing her.
You know, I faked it.
(confused) What?!
Yeah.
You faked it? Why would you do that?
Well you know, if it's enough already and I just wanna get some sleep.
Yeah, but why would you... (Kramer is eating a peach then disgusted he spits it out) Bad peach?
It's terrible!
Did you get that at Joe's?
Yeah, of course I got it at Joe's.
That's surprising, his fruit is usually the best.
You know what I'm gonna do? (heading for the door) I'm gonna return this.
You're returning used fruit?
Jerry this peach is sub par.
Joe's]
So what do you want me to do?
I want restitution.
Restitution? You want restitution? Why should I give you restitution?
Because it's no good.
When you put that fruit out, that's where it ends for me.
It's still your fruit, you gotta stand behind your fruit.
I stand behind my fruit.
So...
Hey, you got a bad peach? That's an act of God. He makes the peaches. I don't make the peaches, I sell the peaches. You have a problem? You talk to him.
You know this whole place is going vrrrrrrrrrrrrt, downhill. I could have come in here last week with a bad plum but I let it go.
Well let me put a solution for ya do your business elsewhere, I don't want your business.
Oh now you don't want my business.
No, I don't want your business and from this moment you're banned from the store, you're banned!
But what am I gonna do for fruit?
restaurant]
(moaning) Mmmmm, Mmmm, Hmmhmmhmmm (lights a cigarette) Mmmm (takes a puff) Woo
(thinking of the moans) Heh. (Karen takes another puff of her cigarette) You seem like you really enjoyed your Risotto. (chuckles) You have a very contented air over there. (chuckles again) You look very contented, very satisfied. (pauses) Are you satisfied?
I'm very satisfied.
I-I'm sure if you weren't satisfied you would probably say something wouldn't you?
I probably would. But then again I'm an enigma.
Hey listen... umm, instead of the movie... uh, maybe we'll go back and uh you know...(nudges her head with his head)
Maybe.
So... uh you feel okay about that whole thing... what we do in there... you're generally okay with everything in there?
Generally.
Do you uh feel the way you feel after the Risotto?
Well no, I feel full after the Risotto.
Yeah...(scratching his head) full.
(another) restaurant]
Oh god, Mmmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmmmm, Mmm, Ah, Woo
Satisfied?
Mmm, hey, you know what? You wanna go see that new Meryl Streep movie?
Meryl Streep?
You don't like her?
Ah, she's okay.
I love her Jerry, she's so authentic. I really believe everything is actually happening to her. There's no acting there.
Yeah. You don't want coffee or anything do you?
I really admire actors, you know. It's just such an incredible skill.
Yeah, yeah, can we get off of this?
What's the matter?
Nothing.
You're not still thinking about that are you?
Nooo.
Oh good.
Give me another shot!
(shocked) What?
Another shot, I want another shot.
You mean...?
Yes!
Oooh no, I don't think so.
Come on! One shot, I can do it, I know I can do it!
Jerry, we're friends! We can't do that, it would ruin our friendship.
Oh friendship... friendship, shmanship .
Jerry no, that's important to me.
We won't ruin the friendship.
Ya, Yes we will!
Elaine...
No Jerry, it is out of the question. You know what sex does to a friendship, it kills it.
A half hour, give me a half our.
No!
Okay, fifteen minutes. I guarantee you fifteen minutes, I can make it happen!
Noo!
You're worried I'll be able to do it aren't you?
What, no, it doesn't matter. Jerry, I don't care.
That's it, that's it. You like having this over me, you don't want me to do it.
That is so ridiculous.
Come on, Elaine!
No.
Elaine?!
No!
Karen's bedroom]
It's Jerry's fault.
Jerry?
Jerry and Elaine. They made me nuts.
Oh I don't care, George, really it's all right.
So you feel okay?
Well, it's not like after the Risotto.
Jerry's car]
Well good night.
I still don't understand why we had to walk out on that movie.
Oh that Meryl Streep, she's such a phony baloney.
Goodnight. Thanks for a really fabulous evening (sarcastic).
Oh what, you're upset?
Yes I'm upset, can't you tell?
No I can't, maybe you're faking.
I'm really, really sorry I told you that.
I'm sorry too.
Well stop being such a baby.
You're a baby!
You're a baby!
Jerry's apartment]
It's all your fault! You and Elaine! All that orgasm talk. She did have an orgasm, she didn't have an orgasm. Orgasm this, orgasm that. I got so focused on it. I started to panic and boom, I lost it. I tried everything, I was talking to him 'Please wake up, do something.'
They're mysterious little fellows aren't they?
I hate him!
You know it happens to everybody. It happened to Houdini. And he could get out of a trunk under water with his hands in chains! But he had a problem with that. The miracle is that it ever happens.
It's like a magic trick. Sometimes I think it would be easier to bend a spoon mentally than to make that transformation.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey listen, if I give you money would you go out and get me some fruit?
Why can't you get it?
Well I got banned from the store I can't go back in there now.
What happened?
Well you know, we had a fight over the peach and uh well Joe doesn't want my business.
Hey, was that a joke about Houdini?
(to George) No. (to Kramer) I told you not to say anything.
Jerry, what am I gonna do for fruit?
Well you'll have to go to the supermarket.
The supermarket? That's impossible! They don't have a decent piece of fruit at the supermarket. The apples are mealy, the oranges are dry. I don't know what's going on with the Papayas! Jerry you gotta go to Joe's, you gotta get me some fruit!
Oh so what I'm going to buy all your fruit now?
Well if Houdini couldn't do it, what chance do I have?
Hello... Oh hi Patty, thanks for calling me back. I-I just wanted to ask you a question when we we're going out did you have orgasms?... Okay, thanks... No that's it... Ya, Okay, bye.
Patty Lawrence had 'em!
Alright look I'm gonna make you a fruit list, all right?
Yeah.
Hello Elaine? Patty Lawrence had orgasms what do you think about that? And I got calls in to six other women and I bet you they confirm an orgasm too. So what do you have to say now Elaine?... Hello?
outside Joe's]
Why do I feel like I'm doing something wrong?
All right now here's the list. (hands Jerry the list)
All this? It's too much. What do you need five mangos for?
I like mangos.
Avocado? I don't know how to pick out an avocado.
Well they gotta be soft.
How soft?
Not too soft. Better too hard than too soft.
(looking over the list) Hmm ah. I'm not going through this every week, I tell you that right now. And what are these? Plums? What is that?
Yeah now get the ones that are red on the inside.
Uh huh. Well how do I know what they look like on the inside? What do they look like on the outside?
Oh! And get some plantains. (grabs the list to write them down)
Plantains?
Yeah.
What the hell is a plantain.
It's part of the banana family. It's a delicacy.
(grabbing the list from Kramer) You're not getting any plantains.
Hey Joe.
How's it going?
Good, just getting some fruit for myself. Uh, gotta have fruit in the house. I like it as a snack. Wholesome, natural, chock-full of vitamins. Alright let's see... mangos... four plums with red on the inside... avocado... (looks at Joe; Joe gives him a weird look)ooo, just right... and three plantains uh ought to do it.
All right, all right, just hold it right there.
What?
This fruit isn't for you.
(shocked) Wha, what are you talking about?
You think I don't know huh? Mangos, plantains, plums with the red on the inside, that's Kramer!
I can't buy mangos and plantains?
All right, get out!
You're making a big mistake, Joe!
I'll tell you something else I don't what your business anymore either.
Are saying you're banning me from the store?
That's exactly what I'm saying.
I'm banned?!
You're banned.
Jerry's apartment]
All right, where do you want it?
Put it over there.
Yes! Oh look at this, these mangos are beautiful! Oh these are beautiful, (smells them) you did good George.
All right I gotta get going.
What are you doing?
I got a date with Karen. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Nothing happening down there.
You're thinking about it too much. You're putting too much emphasis on it.
I knew this was gonna happen some day. It was inevitable. I've known it ever since I was a little kid. I've been waiting for it.
This mango is delicious!
That reminds me, I'm not getting you guys any more fruit. That guy was eyeballing me the whole time. He gave me the creeps. All right, you owe me twenty-eight sixty.
Sorry, I don't have any cash.
I only got hundreds.
You see... All right I knew it.
Come on, come on, we're gonna pay you! Here have some mango.
I don't want any mango.
Come on, take some. It's good.
Very good. Juicy.
Ya.
Ripe. Boy, this Joe's got some terrific fruit.
Mmm.
What?
I feel like I got a B12 shot. This is like a taste explosion!
Ya I told you.
What is it?
I think it moved. Oh my god, I think it moved. Yeah, give me the big piece. I'll see you later.
Hi George.
I'm back, baby, I'm back!
Want some mango?
Noo, thanks.
Well well, if it isn't the first lady of the American Theatre. (Elaine smiles and rolls her eyes at him) What brings you here?
Just gonna return some of your things that were in my house.
Oh and I've got some things of yours here.
I know.
Well I'll get them.
I'm waiting.
All right. (goes into his hallway and comes back) You got my fins?
Yeah I got your fins. You got my poker chips?
I got your poker chips. You got my goggles?
They're next to the fins. You got my cards?
They're next to the poker chips.
All right and that just about... does it.
I guess.
Okay, welp... see you around.
Yeah, see you.
All right, let's go, I give you half an hour.
(shocked) What?
Come on!
Are you serious?
Look, Jerry, we have to have sex to save the friendship.
Sex... to save the friendship. (Elaine drops her bag, takes off her jacket and walks into Jerry's bedroom) Well, if we have to (un-tucks his shirt) we have to.
Karen's bedroom]
Mmmm, Oh George, oooh.
Please, it's not necessary.
Mmm What's not necessary?
The little extra moan you threw in there. Laying it on a bit thick, don't you think?
What are you talking about?
What am I talking about? Come on. (laughing) You don't think I bought all that? (does a little move)
What, what?
You're very good. Very good with the moanings and the gyrations. Y-You really had me going there for a minute.
You think I was faking?
Come on 'Oh George, oh Geeeooorge!' Come on! Not that I don't appreciate the effort that was put into it.
I'd like you to leave.
What?
I said, I would like you to leave. Come on, just get your clothes on and get out.
But why?
Because I said so. (pushes George off the bed)
I-I-I can't find my glasses.
Well hurry up.
I need to look for my glasses.
(seen through George eyes all blurry) Get out! Get out!! Get out!!!
Jerry's bedroom]
It's all George's fault. All that talk about impotence. It got to me. And that orgasm stuff orgasm this and orgasm that. It's a lot of pressure!
You know I'm a little hungry. You wouldn't happen to have any of that mango left?
the real and the fake. And uh I'll tell you right now, as a man, we don't know. We do not know, because to a man sex is like a car accident and determining the female orgasm is like being asked 'What did you see after the car went out of control?'. 'Uh I heard a lot of screeching sounds, uh I remember I was facing the wrong way at one point. And in the end my body was thrown clear.
Jerry's apartment]
I can't believe this.
Oh, it won't be for that long.
How can I do this? How can I move back in with those people? Please, tell me. They're insane. You know that.
Hey, my parents are just as crazy as your parents.
How can you compare you parents to my parents?!
My father has never thrown anything out. Ever!
My father wears his sneakers in the pool! Sneakers!
My mother has never set foot in a natural body of water.
(Showing Jerry up) Listen carefully. My mother has never laughed. Ever. Not a giggle, not a chuckle, not a tee-hee.. never went 'Ha!'
A smirk?
Maybe!.. And I'm moving back in there!
I told you I'd lend you the money for the rent.
No, no, no, no. Borrowing money from a friend is like having sex. It just completely changes the relationship.
Alright. I'm ready. (To George) You know, I still don't understand - why do you want to move back in with your parents?
I don't want to! I'm outta money! I got 714 dollars left in the bank.
Well, move in here.
(Stopping the notion) What's that?
Why doesn't he just move in here?
(Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna move in with him. He doesn't even let you use the toilet!
You can move in with me, if you want.
(Sincerely) Thank you.. I, uh.. that might not work out.
The Costanza's house]
Careful! Careful with the suitcases! We just painted!
Hello, Mrs. Costanza.
(quietly) Hello, Mrs. Costanza.
(not really noticing Jerry said Hello) Hello, Kramer. Close the door.
Well, I gotta bring in more stuff. (Heads for the door)
More stuff?!
Yeah. (Exits)
(To George) How much is there?!
(Annoyed) There's more.
So, how are ya, Jerry?
Fine, Mrs. Costanza. (Attempts to get Estelle to laugh) Hey, I got a terrific joke for you..
(Sits down on the couch) Nah, not interested.
No, no. It-It's really funny. There's these two guys-
(Interrupting) Tell it to the audience. (George gives Jerry an 'I told you so' look) Here, (Picks up a plate full of sandwiches) I made some bologna sandwiches.
Bologna?! No one eats bologna anymore!
What are you talking about?! (to Jerry) Have a sandwich.
(setting down a box) No thanks.
Oh, stop it! You don't want one, Kramer?
Uhh.. no thanks. (Goes back out the door)
I think you're all a little touched in the head. (Puts the plate down) You're so worried about your health.. You're young men.
I really don't eat it.
What am I gonna do with all these sandwiches?! Will you take them home? Give them to someone in your building?
I don't know if I'd feel comfortable handing out bologna sandwiches in the building..
(Enters with a box) Alright, that's it. Anything else?
(Muttering) No, that's it.
Oh, I gotta go move the car. Alright (Leaves)
Well, I guess we'll be going.. (Heads for the door)
(Runs over to him, not wanting him to leave) What? You're going?
Yeah.
Wha - what are you doing later?
Oh, Elaine and I are going out to dinner with Kramer and his new girlfriend.
Really?
Yeah, You can't believe this woman. She's one of those low-talkers. You can't hear a word she's saying! You're always going 'excuse me?', 'what was that?'
Yeah.. may - maybe I'll meet ya?
No, George. We're going out to eat tonight with your father.
(Mutters) Oh.. okay.. talk to you later.
Yeah, take it easy. (Leaves)
Oh, my God.. (Buries his face into his hands)
A Restaurant]
Okay, well, he had this idea of a pizza place where you make your own pie! (Laughs)
Right.
You remember that?
Yeah, well, that was a good one.
Well..
What's that?
Excuse me?
Yeah.. yeah.
Yep. Yeah..
You know that, uh, Leslie (Points to her) is in the clothing business? She's a designer.
(Interested) Oh?
In fact, she's come up with a new one that is going to be the big new look in men's fashion.. It's a, a puffy shirt. (Leslie mumbles to Kramer) Well, yeah, it - it's all puffy. Like the pirates used to wear.
Oh, a puffy shirt.
Puffy.
Yeah, see, I think people want to look like pirates. You know, it's the right time for it.. to be all puffy, and devil-may-care..
(Still laughing) That's true.. (Gets up) I'll be right back. (Walks off laughing. Jerry and Elaine are left with the low-talker. A moment passes)
Uh, o... (Remembers something they could talk about) Jerry's going to be on the "Today" show on Friday.
Yeah, that's right!
Yep.. yep. Um, he's promoting a (pauses) benefit for Goodwill, you know, they, uh, they clothe the (clears her throat) poor, and the homeless..
(Points at Elaine) And the indigent.
And the indigent, yeah.. I, I do volunteer work for them. I-I set the whole thing up, and I got Jerry to do it.
Sure.
Ohh, yeah. Yeah.. yep.
Uh-huh.
Yep.
Yep..
Mmm
A Restaurant]
Maybe you should take a civil service test.
(Studying the salt shaker) I'm not taking a civil service test.
Look at this, George. (Takes a coin out of his pocket) You ever seen a silver dollar?
Yes, I've seen a silver dollar.
Why don't you want to take a civil service test?
To do what?! Work in a post office? Is that what you want me to do?
Would you believe when I was 18, I had a ssssilver dollar collection?
I don't understand. You get job security - you get a pay check every week..
I'm a college graduate. You want me to be a mailman?
(Still looking at his coin) You know, I couldn't bring myself to spend one of these. I got some kind of a-a-a-a-a phobia.
So what are you gonna do?!
I don't know. I do know that I have some kind of a talent - something to offer. I just don't know what it is yet!
I bet that collection would be worth a lot of money today. (does a form of magic trick making the coin disappear as he shows George an empty hand)
(Looks fed up with his parents) Oh my God..
I don't like this waiter. (Holds up his hand to get the waiters attention - starts snapping) Look at him.. He sees us.. he doesn't want to come over.
(Needing to get away from his parents, he gets up) I need some air..
George, where are you going?!
(Walks off) I got a lot of thinking to do.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.. (Bends down, and starts picking up her things)
Look at what you've done! You spilled my bag!
(Stuttering) I, I, I, .. here, let me - let me help you..
No, no ,no. It's all right. (Begins helping him pick her things up)
It - it's just that I'm here with my parents, and my mother wants me to take a civil service test - and to tell you the truth, I don't even think I'd pass it.. So..
Hmm..
What?
(Looking at both his hands intensely) Your hands.
What about them?
They're quite exquisite!
They are?
(Mesmerized) Extraordinary! Have you ever done any hand modeling?
Hand modeling? (Shakes his head 'No')
(Fishes a card out of her purse, then hands it to George) Here's my card. Why don't you, uh, give me a call? (Walks off)
Jerry's apartment]
(Shrugs) I - I don't get it.
Me neither!
What is it?
I don't know.
They're hands!
This woman just set me up for a job!
(Gets up, and displays his own hands) Well, what about my hands? I don't see how your hands are any better than my hands.
What, are you kidding? (Points at the flaws of Jerry's hands) The knuckles are all out of proportion. you got hair over there - where do you get off comparing your hands to my hands?! This is a one-in-a-million hand. (Points to his own hand)
Well, that's what comes from avoiding manual labor your whole life.
This is it! It happened to me, Jerry! I was sitting in the restaurant, the two nut jobs were talking - I couldn't take it any more. I got up, and (Makes a noise) I bop into this woman..
It's just like in the movies.
Hey. (He's carrying a suit cover. He hangs it on Jerry's coat hooks)
Hey.
Hey, George! (Holds out his hand. George shakes it - a hand buzzer goes off. George starts freaking out. Kramer laughs)
OH!!!! What are you, crazy?! Are you, crazy?!
What?!
You coulda damaged my hand!
(Laughing) But, it's only a toy!
(Explaining) George has become a hand model.
A hand model?
Yes.
(To George) Really? Let me see your hands.
(Defensively) You can look at them, but do NOT touch them. (Holds them out)
Let's see.. (studies them) oh, those are nice. You know, I've never noticed this before? They're smooth.. creamy.. delicate, yet (Turns to Jerry) masculine.
(Takes two oven mitts from his back pack) Alright, (puts them on) I gotta get going.
Oven mitts?
(Embarrassed) That's all I could find. (A moment passes) Would you mind getting the door?
Yeah..
Alright. (Jerry opens the door for George)
Thank you very much. (Walks out)
You're not going to believe what happening with Leslie. You know, ever since you agreed to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show, she's been getting all these orders from boutiques and department stores..
Uh-huh.. (Finally realizes what Kramer said, he looks up) Since I said what?
Agreed to wear the puffy shirt. (Starts unzipping the suit cover)
What are you talking about?
When you said that you'd agree to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show. (Takes the ridiculous puffy shirt out of the cover)
(Goes up to it) This?
Yea.
I agreed to wear this?!
Yeah, yeah.
But, when did I do that?
When we went to dinner the other night.
What are you, crazy?!
What were you talking about when I went to the bathroom?
I don't know! I couldn't understand a word she was saying! I was just nodding!
(makes his pop sound) There you go.
Where I go? You mean she was asking me to wear this ridiculous shirt on national TV, and I said 'Yes'?!
Yes, yes! You said it!
But, I - I didn't know what she was talking about. I couldn't hear her!
(Takes it off the hook, and starts walking toward Jerry with it. He backs defensively backs away from it) Well, she asked you.
I - I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV! I mean, look at it! It looks ridiculous!
Well, you gotta wear it now! All those stores are stocking it based on the condition that you're gonna wear this on the TV show! The factory in New Jersey is already makin' em.
They're making these?
Yes, yes. This pirate trend that she's come up with, Jerry, this-this is gonna be the new look for the 90's. You're gonna be the first pirate!
(Like a little kid) But, I don't want to be a pirate!
The Costanza house]
I knew it. I knew it.. I always knew you always had beautiful hands. I used to tell people. Frank, didn't I use to talk about his hands?
(Looking up from his paper) Who the hell did'ya ever mention his hands to?
(Getting annoyed) I mentioned his hands to plenty of people!
You never mentioned them to me!
(Snaps, then points to the coffee table) Hand me an Emory board.
I always talk about your hands - how they're so soft and milky white..
No! You never said milky white!
(Getting angry) I said milky white!
(To Estelle) Scissor. (She gets the scissors from the coffee table and hands them to George with the point facing him) Don't hand them to me with the point facing out!
I'm sorry.
You're sorry?!
(Apologizing) I'll try to be more careful.
(Stern, angered) I hope so. (Takes the scissors)
Georgie.. (Nudges George's arm, disrupting his work with the scissors) Oh, Georgie, would you like some Jell-O?
(To Estelle, referring to the Jell-O) Why'd you put the bananas in there?!
(Yelling) George likes the bananas!
(Trying to match her tone) So let him have bananas on the side!
Alright! Please, please! I cannot have this constant bickering!.. Stress is very damaging to the epidermis! Now, I have an important photo session in the morning - my hands have got to be in tip-top shape, so please - keep the television down, and the conversation to a minimum.
(Meek) But Georgie.. what about the Jell-O?
(Definite) I'll take it in my room. (Walks off)
A Today Show dressing room]
Yeah, come in.
I just wanted to let you know he's got about five minutes.
Giddy-Up. (Stagehand leaves) Jerry! Five minutes!
Now that's a great looking shirt! (Gets up, admiring the shirt) Aye Captain! (Growls like a pirate) Yeah! I'm glad I ironed it. It's perfect. (Walks around Jerry, inspecting the shirt) Look at it! It's fantastic!
(Resisting) Kramer, how am I gonna wear this?! I-I can't wear this!
(Reassuring) Hey, this look's better than anything you own. You know, in two months time, everybody's gonna be wearing the (imitates a pirate) pirate look!
Yeah.
Hi, Kramer. Guess what - I just saw Bryant Gumbel, he said he might help out at the benefit!
Great.
(Between laughs) What is that?!
It's the puffy shirt. Look at it, eh? Whatd'ya think? Is it cool or what?
(To Jerry) Why're you wearing that now?
(Obviously mad at the situation he's in) 'Why am I wearing is now?? I'll tell you why I'm wearing it now - because the lowtalker asked me to, that's why! And I said 'yes'. Do you know why? Because I couldn't HEAR her!
When did she, (Snickers) when did she ask you this?
When we were at dinner, when Kramer went to the bathroom.
I didn't hear anything.
(Yelling out) Of course not! Nobody hears anything when this woman speaks!
(Just now making the matter serious) Well, you can't wear that on the show.
(To Elaine, muffled, low, and threatening) Elaine, you want to stop?
(Turning around to Kramer) Wha- What? No. (Back to Jerry) Jerry, you are promoting a benefit to CLOTHE homeless people. You can't come out dressed like that! You're all puffed up!.. You look like the Count of Monte Cristo!
(Arms out, complaining) I have to wear it! The woman has orders for this shirt based on me wearing it on TV.. they're producing them as we speak!
(Arguing) Yeah, but you're supposed to be a compassionate person! That cares about poor people! You look like you're gonna.. swing in on a chandelier!
(Looking down at a clipboard, enters) Okay, let's go. (Looks up, points at Jerry's puffy shirt) Is that what you're wearing?
A photographer's studio]
I've never seen hands like these before..
They're so soft and milky white.
You know who's hands they remind me of? (Pauses for effect) Ray McKigney.
Ugh.. Ray.
He was it.
Who was he?
The most exquisite hands you've ever seen.. Oh, he had it all.
(Hands still out, even though they've stopped looking at them) What happened to him?
(Clears throat) Tragic story, I'm afraid. He could've had any woman in the world.. but none could match the beauty of his own hand.. and that became his one true love..
You mean, uh..?
Yes. he was not.. master of his domain.
(Makes a gesture saying he understands. The man nods) But how.. uh..?
(Quick, to the point) The muscles.. became so strained with.. overuse, that eventually the hand locked into a deformed position, and he was left with nothing but a claw. (Holds hand up, displaying a claw-like shape) He traveled the world seeking a cure.. acupuncturists.. herbalists.. swamis.. nothing helped. Towards the end, his hands became so frozen the was unable to manipulate utensils, (Visibly disgusted by this last part) and was dependent on Cub Scouts to feed him. I hadn't seen another pair of hands like Ray McKigney's until today. You are his successor. (George looks down at his hands) I uh only hope you have a little more self-control.
(Smiling to himself) You don't have to worry about me. (Nodding, gloating) I won a contest.
Ok, let's get to work.
The Today Show]
(Talking directly to the camera) Back now, 746. On Tuesday the 19th here in New York there will be a benefit for the Goodwill Industries - a used clothing organization that provides services to the needy. One of the performers will be comedian Jerry Seinfeld. (Turns to face Jerry) Jerry, good morning.
(Mumbling out) Thank you, Bryant.
(Pointing out) And speaking of clothing, that is a very, very unusual shirt you have on.
(Looking down at the shirt; mumbling) Oh, thank you.
You're all kinda, (Waves his hands around) kinda "puffed up". (Chuckles)
Yeah, it's a puffy shirt.
(Laughing) You look kinda like a pirate.
(Nervous laughter) Yeah.. like a pirate.. (Attempting to get on another subject) Anyway, ah, you know, we're hoping to, um, raise enough money.. with this.. uh..
(Rudely interrupting, still snickering at the shirt) You.. ah, look, I'm sorry, it is just a VERY unusual shirt. It could be kind of a whole new look for you.. you know, you could put a patch over an eye, you could be kind of like the pirate-comedian.
Uh-huh, yeah. (Smiling, nodding, clearly wanting Bryant to shut up)
Are you going to be wearing the shirt at the concert?
(Losing it, mad) Look, it's not my shirt.
(Confused) Whose shirt is it?
What's the difference? I agreed to wear it. It's - it's a puffy shirt. I feel ridiculous in it, and I think it's the stupidest shirt I've ever seen, to be perfectly honest with you. (Nodding)
(Off camera, shrill, high pitched yelling) You bastard!
(To Jerry) Did you hear that?
(Pointing off screen, nodding) THAT I heard.
Photographer's studio]
(Instructing George) Alright, a little to the left.. Little higher, little higher. Good. Perfect! Perfect.
Like that?
Just like that. Hold it. (Takes picture) Good, ok, let me get just one more, one more. (Takes another picture) Good, that's it. You're done.
That's it?
(Smiling) That's it.
(Pulling a slip of paper out of his coat pocket) And here's your check. (George accepts) Thank you very much. (Pats him on the back) It was an honor.
It was great working with you. (Somewhat coy) Your hands are beautiful.
(Modest) Oh, thank you very much. (Chuckles)
You know, I was wondering - if you're not doing anything later, maybe you'd like to get together..?
Park]
Today Show dressing room]
You ruined me! You ruined my career!
Oh, just keep your voice down. Everyone can hear you.
(Shouting out) Oh, I don't give a damn!
(Reasoning) You know, if you talked this loud to begin with, I wouldn't be in this costume in the first place!
(Quick, excited talking) Hey, hey! You can't believe this. Look at this check! (Hands it to Jerry) They told me I had the most beautiful hands they'd ever seen in their lives - except for this McKigney guy - this great looking girl gave me her phone number.. I got it! I got it all! I'm busting. Jerry, I'm busting!
Hey, I've never noticed your hands before. Let me see.
Alright. (Holds them up)
(Obviously not impressed, dull) Yeah, real nice.
(Turning back to Jerry, he takes the check back. He just now notices the shirt Jerry's wearing, and snickers, pointing) Nice shirt.. (Laughs, Jerry shrugs) What is this? Is this what you wore on the show?
Yeah.
What, have you completely lost your mind?
(Faint, trying to shut George up) Hey..
Who's dressing you? (Laughs) You look like a complete idiot! You know, I wouldn't wipe my- (Unable to take anymore, Leslie gets up and shoves George violently. His hands go straight for the hot iron sitting on the dressing room table. George screams out in agony) AAHHHH!!!!! (his voice is heard outside the building, on the street, and in the park were a bunch of pigeons are scared by the yelling)
A Restaurant]
You ready?
Ow! Hot! Hot!
(Sincere) I'm sorry.
(Reflecting on his life gone wrong) This McKigney guy had a few good years.. (To Kramer, bitter) How could you forget to turn off an iron?
Well, I was excited because Jerry was putting on the puffy shirt.
My whole life is ruined because of the (Mocking, bitter tone) "puffy shirt".
(Pointing out) It didn't do me any good either! That benefit was the worst show I ever did. Some of those heckles were really uncalled for "Avast ye matey" - what the hell does that mean?! "20 degrees off the starboard side - the Spanish Galleon!" - there's no comeback for that!
(Reflecting) Well, it got me fired from the benefit committee.
You know all those stores canceled out on her? She's finished. (Concluding) We're (Leslie and him) finished.
Really? What happened?
(Showing pure irony) I just can't be with someone who's life is in complete disarray.
What happened with all the shirts?
They gave them all to Goodwill.
Ahh, can you spare a little change for an old buccaneer?
(While digging in his pocket for some money, he looks over the shirts one last time) You know, it's really not a bad looking shirt..
Do you ever spit on anybody from here?
No. You?
No. Do you ever think about it?
Yeah.
Me too.
Hey.
Hey.
Well I got it!
You got me the air conditioner?
What do you think?
Beautiful!
What air conditioner?
Well my buddy works in an appliance store and he got us thirty percent off.
Is it a good one?
Good one? It's the Commando 8.
Commando 8?
12,000 BTU's.
I thought you hated air conditioning. You've never had an air conditioner.
Yeah, but Amy likes air conditioning.
Oooh, you're getting an air conditioner for Amy. (In a wining voice) Amy doesn't like the temperature up here. She's a little hoooot.
All right.
Okay, so, I'm gonna measure the window up, okay buddy?
Yeah.
Yeah. (George enters the apartment wearing goggles) Yeah, rock on!
I gotta get out of this city.
So you're tunneling to the center of the Earth? (Elaine laughs silently)
I'm at the health club and while I'm in the pool, some guy walks off with my glasses. Who steals prescription glasses?
You don't have an old pair?
I broke 'em playing basketball.
He was running from a bee. (Elaine laughs)
Now if I wanna see anything I gotta wear these.
George, those are prescription goggles? What is there to see in a health club pool?
There's a lot of change down there.
When I find that guy, this much I vow those glasses will be returned to their rightful owner.
We're behind you, Aquaboy. Godspeed!
What kind of a sick, demented person wants another person's glasses?
Yeah, especially those frames.
You know what you ought to do? Go see my friend Dwayne at J & T Optical on Columbus Avenue. He'll give you thirty percent off.
Yeah, come on.
Hey, he just got me thirty percent off on an air conditioner.
Really?
Retail is for suckers.
Wow. Uh, what do I have to do?
You just gotta mention my name.
That's it?
That's it. (smacks George on the forehead with a ruler)
What about these?
They look good. I liked the other one too. I've liked about five of them.
Well, it's a tough decision. I have to wear these every day. I'm deciding on a new face.
(bored) Come on, George. Pick a face and go with it.
Now those look good, they're very bold.
Yes, they are bold. Jerry, what do you think?
(While looking at posters of women wearing glasses) I think these women would be pretty good looking if they weren't wearing glasses.
Hi there, little doggy. (to owner) Do you mind if I pet your dog?
It's okay with me.
Hey little doggy. (Elaine pets the dog and he bites her) Aaah!
Hey, you can't have that dog in here.
Are you okay? Did he bite ya?
Can you believe that guy?
I'm okay, it's just a nip.
He just walked away! And once again I'm standing here like a little man. Well not this time! (George leaves the store and follows the dog owner) You! Dog man!
My leg looks pretty bad.
Oh I'm gonna take you over to the emergency room.
Okay.
(To George) Hey, any luck? Did you catch 'em?
Uuh, no, no.
All right, I'm gonna take Elaine over to the hospital.
(In a really strange way) Good, good, do that.
What's the matter?
Oh, no, nothing.
What is it?
I can't tell you.
(pulling on Jerry's pants from the ground) Jerry, can we go?
Yeah, yeah, in a second, in a second. (And to George) What do you mean you can't tell me?
I can't tell you, don't ask.
I'm asking!
Jerry, my leg.
Yeah, yeah, take care of it. (Jerry throws her some toilet paper) Come on, George, what is it?
I saw Amy making out with your cousin Jeffrey.
What?
They were right outside!
Amy and Jeffrey?
Yes!
Are you sure?
Yes, positive.
But you can't see, there's no lenses in those frames.
I know! I was squinting.
Okay, listen, Jerry, you just catch up with me okay? You can just follow the trail of blood.
We're gonna have to talk about this later. (Elaine holds the door open for Jerry while holding her leg) Thank you. Taxi!
(To the store owner) Excuse me, what do you think of these?
Oh, we just got those in. It's a very exciting new frame.
Yes, it is exciting! All right, this is gonna be my new face.
All right, do you have a prescription?
Yeah. (George hands over the prescription) Kramer...
What?
Kramer...
What about him?
You do know Kramer?
Yes...
Well, I'm mentioning his name.
Why?
Because... you know...
No, I don't know. Look, I'm gonna need a deposit on these.
Oh, come on. Cousin Jeffrey? It's not possible!
Why not? They could have met. She loves the park, he works for the Parks Department.
Jerry, that is so ridiculous. But, George didn't even have his glasses on!
But he was squinting.
So what? Squinting doesn't make that much of a difference.
Are you kidding? I've seen 'em squint. He can squint his way down to like twenty, thirty vision. Once we were driving down from the Catskills and he lost his glasses. He squinted his way from Wortsborough down to the Tappan Zee Bridge! He was spotting raccoons, on the road!
Okay.
Okay? That's it? I don't need a shot?
Not shot, dog bite.
No, no, no. I know I wasn't shot. Do I need a shot?
Not shot, dog bite. Woof woof, not bang bang.
Nah, look at this. Cable's out.
Oh that's okay, we don't have to watch tv.
No, no, no. No trouble at all, it's a principal the thing. (Jerry picks up the phone and dials the number) I like them to know that I know what's going on. That they're not... getting away with anything. Oh, I'm on hold. So, what did you do yesterday?
Yesterday?
Yeah, you remember yesterday? Beautiful day... good day to be... out.
I didn't do anything.
(laughing) Oh you must have done something.
No, nothing really.
Didn't go out of the house? Didn't take a walk... on Columbus Avenue?
Well, I did go out for a little while.
Well, your day's getting more interesting already. (Jerry shows the phone) Ah, see, told me they'd be back in a minute and THEY lied.
You can't thrust anyone.
No you can't. (hangs up the phone) Now let's cut the ball, sister! You think I don't know about you swapping spit with somebody yesterday on Columbus Avenue?
What are you talking about?
Look, my friend saw you.
Saw me? With who?
You tell me.
There's nothing to tell.
There isn't?
No.
Oh... all right... wanna get some pizza?
I had a feeling this was to good to be true.
Why?
I knew there had to be another side to you.
No, no, there's no side!
There is a side, an ugly side.
No, no, no ugly side.
Look, I think I'm gonna go.
Why?
It's really hot in here.
Uuh, so we can still go out on Friday though?
Yeah. When you getting an air conditioner?
It's coming! It's a Commando 8! 12.000 BTU's! It's gonna be like a meat locker in here.
I was an idiot for listening to you!
Hey, I saw what I saw.
Ooh, everything was going so well. She hadn't seen any flaws in me. Now she sees a side.
What side?
A bad side, an ugly side.
Ooh, so what?
So what? I wasn't planning on showing that side for another six months. Now you make me throw off the whole learning curve.
Why don't you just ask Jeffrey?
Ah, he'd just deny it.
There must be some way to find out.
Amy said nothing happened.
What, you're gonna take her word over mine? I'm your best friend!
Yeah, but you're blind as a bat!
I was squinting! Remember that drive from Wortsborough? (snapping his fingers) I was spotting those raccoons.
They were mailboxes, you idiot. I didn't have the heart to tell you.
(noticing something) Hey look, a dime.
Heh, Mercury head. You mind?
(Stunned) No, keep it. (Elaine enters the apartment) Hey what happened to you? You buzzed five minutes ago.
There was a dog in front of the building and it spooked me. I couldn't come in until he left.
A little white dog?
Yeah.
Snowball? You were afraid of Snowball?
I'm afraid of dogs now.
He's like a squirrel.
Well he frightened me.
Did you get the shot?
No. He said I didn't need a shot.
You got bit by a strange dog and you didn't get a rabies shot?
What, you think I should have?
You know, you should just go back to the optical store and ask Dwayne if he knows the name of the owner of the dog.
All right, that's a good idea. I'm gonna do that.
The AC is on it's way.
Pardon me, I went to see your friend Dwayne... there was no discount.
What?
That's right, no discount!
Well did you mention my name?
Yes, I mentioned your name.
And?
Pbbbs, Bubkis!
Now I don't believe this. That guy owes me big time. I got him off sugar! Look, I'm gonna go down there with you right now.
All right, let me just... I'm gonna grap an apple.
Hey, Kramer, Elaine's afraid of Snowball!
Little Snowball? He runs on batteries!
You know, George, that's an onion.
Yes it is.
He couldn't tell an apple from an union and he's your eye witness?
I saw them making out, you can believe it.
I don't know what to believe! You're eating unions, you're spotting dimes, I don't know what the hell is going on.
Look, all you gotta to do, is get Amy and Jeffrey together somewhere, that's it.
Hey wait a second, wait a second. I'm going over to Jeffrey's apartment tomorrow night to pick up these Paul Simon tickets. I'm gonna surprise Amy. All I gotta do is bring her with me. And then when Jeffrey opens the door, it's Howdy Doody time.
Right this way, mister Doody!
(crying from the onion) You'll see I'm right.
Hey, Dwayny.
Oh hello Kramer.
What is going on here?
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about the thirty percent discount.
Uhm excuse me... uh... a man came in here...
Elaine, don't interrupt, they're discounting something.
Who said anything about a discount.
Ooh, how quickly we forget. You owe me buddy.
For what?
Remember this?
What are you doing?
Six months ago you were eating four of those for breakfast and chasing it with a ring ding. And two butter fingers on the train. Sounds familiar?
Put that away!
Remember that night I found you at Dinky Donuts? You were all *hopped* up on cinnamon swirls! They wouldn't serve you anymore! You wouldn't even have any teeth if it wasn't for me taking you over to Joe's fruit stand and stuffin' cantaloupe down your throat! So much for gratitude... yeah, yeah, yeah!
All right, all right, all right! I'll give him the discount, just put that thing away! This squares us.
Can I just have the name...
Out!
We'll see you Dwayne.
I don't know what to tell you, Elton.
(While reading a book) Oh oh, listen to this, this is not good, listen to these symptoms for rabies anxiety, irritability. I got those, I'm irritable!
(To George) Who picked these out?
I did!
They're ladies' glasses! You know all you need is that little chain around your neck so you can wear 'em while you're playing Canasta.
Well Elaine was supposed to help me.
Hey! I got bit by a dog! I had to go to the hospital! I was bleeding to death! I can't solve every little problem you have!
Hey, hey.
I'm sorry... sorry.
Commando 8 has arrived!
Take it to the window.
12.000 BTU's of raw cooling power. (Kramer places the air conditioner in the window) Installed!
That's it? You don't have to screw it in or anything?
No, just plug it in and the Commando 8 does the rest. (And to Jerry) I'll seal that up later, right?
Just in time for Amy.
Oh yeah, when are you gonna execute that plan?
I've got such a headache. Oh, that's another symptom!
Of what?
Rabies.
Oh that's fatal, you don't want that!
I know I don't want it! I don't need you to tell me what I don't want, you stupid hipster dufus!
Hey, hey, what is this? What's going on here?
I'm sorry, Kramer, I'm sorry.
No, no, it's all right. I had a friend who had rabies once. (George's eating chips) May I have one of those, madam?
Madam? What are you calling me madam for?
They're ladies' glasses.
Now look here, see it's right here Gloria Vanderbilt Collection.
He sold me ladies' glasses!
I... I think I'm... I'm having trouble swallowing. I can't... I can't swallow.
She's got rabies, just like my friend Bob Sacamano. She's delirious. (Elaine drinks some water and drools) She's foaming at the mouth!
Is this gonna hurt?
Yes, very much.
What if Jeffrey's not home. Did you ever think of that?
Oh he'll be home, it's Friday night. That's the big night on the Nature Channel.
Let me tell you this there is no way cousin Jeffrey is dating Amy. He looks like a horse!
He does look like a horse.
Yeah, he's got a real horse face. (Elaine, while looking out the window) Here, look at this! It's the guy with the dog! (She opens the window and screams) Hey! Hey! You down there! Remember me? I had to get shot because of your stupid dog!
Hey who are you calling stupid?
Hey, shall we spit on him?
No no no no, come on, let's go downstairs.
(Singing) Oh myyyy papayaaaa. (The air conditioner wobbles) The air conditioner! (Kramer tries to keep it from falling by holding it's cord, but it snaps) I think it got the dog!
Ah, Oh boy.
Excuse me, uh I'm new here, would you mind walking me back to my locker?
Oh uuh, sure, why not. (the blind man hangs on to George's arm) Hey, that's the guy.
What guy?
The guy that stole my glasses. This time I got 'em! (George follows the man onto the street, dragging the blind man with him) Would you pick it up a little?
Where the hell are we going?
He's getting on a bus, damn! (To the blind man) Those are nice glasses.
I don't like 'em, they pinch my nose.
Is that right?
Dwayne, my friend and I would like to exchange frames. Could you put his lenses in my frames and mine in his?
(While eating a candy bar) Yeah, we can do that.
And I'd like a discount.
Why should I give you a discount.
Listen, you're lucking I'm not asking for a whole refund. (trying to speak quietly) You gave me ladies' frames!
What's that about ladies' frames?
I'm trying to track down that lady that was in here the other day, the one that was messing with my dog.
Yeah, well, she's trying to track you down.
Well I would love to talk with her. (George chuckles) She lives on 81st Street, right?
No, that's Jerry.
Really? You wouldn't happen to know what apartment he's in, would you?
Yeah, 5A!
Thanks a lot!
So what are we doing here?
Oh, you'll find out.
I don't know, you're acting very mysteriously.
Well, I'm very mysterious by nature. (Jerry knocks on the door) A lot of women find that attractive.
I find it annoying.
Oh?
Helloooo!
Uncle Leo?!
Come on in.
This is Amy.
Hello Amy.
Unlce Leo, what are you doing here?
Jeffrey went out tonight.
Ooh! Very convenient.
I'm supposed to tape this nature show for him, he loves nature. Botany, zoology. You know his botany teacher from college stays in close touch with him? They became friends!
Oh really?
That's pretty rare! I mean, actual friends! Like equals! They have dinner together, they have discussions...
Uncle Leo! Did he leave any tickets here for me?
Oh yeah yeah, I'll get 'em.
Thank you.
What tickets?
To the Paul Simon concert in the park!
We're going to the Paul Simon concert?
That's right, lady!
Oh what a great surprise!
I thought you'd like that.
Oooh, so that's why you've been acting so mysteriously.
Now you know. That, and that alone, is the reason.
You know Jeffrey's favorite animal the leopard.
Why is that?
He likes the spots. Oh uh, here's the tickets.
Thank you.
Oh uh, he asked me to give you a message. He said that uh he's very sorry and uh he hopes you'll forgive 'em.
(To Amy) Aha! So it's true! You were making out with him!
What are you talking about, I don't know Jeffrey. Oh so this is why you brought me up here?
Oh very convincing, but it's not gonna work this time.
What are you talking about? All he meant was that he was sorry that the seats aren't very good.
Oh... oh... wanna get some pizza?
Boy, these really do pinch the nose.
Tough luck! A deal's a deal.
Oh my God it is them.
I still don't know how you spotted that dime. I think you planted it. Plus I had to pay that vet bill for the stupid dog. I don't know how that guy got my name.
Yeah. Hmm. Boy these really do pinch. I tell you, if I ever find the son of a bitch that stole my glasses...
So, does he like you?
What do you think?
You like him?
Yeah, yeah like him, definitely like him. I like him a lot.
So, what's wrong with him?
Nothing, and I've looked.
Well, I'm sure you'll find something.
So, how did you meet him?
In the office.
So, he's a writer.
Yeah.
Yeah, big surprise.
So, I was sitting at the reception desk, I was looking pretty hot. I was wearing my sling back pumps.
What are those?
Ask your mother, (making fun of George's living situation) you live with her now, don't you? Anyway, so then this guy comes up to me and starts feeling my jacket through his thumb and his forefinger like this.
So, what did you do?
I said "So, what do you think?". And he said, "Gabardine?". And I said, "Yeah." That was it.
Wow, just felt your material?
Yeah...Jake Jarmel.
Sounds like a cool guy.
Sounds like a jerk. Felt your material, come on.
Jerry, where did you get that sweater?
Oh, what do you think? I found it at the back of my closet.
I think that's what the back of closets are for.
Hey, that's Barry. Look it's Barry. (taps on the window)
(taps on the window) Hey...
Hi.
Who's that?
That's Barry Prophet, he's our accountant.
I don't know how you can let this guy handle all your money.
Oh, he doesn't handle my money, he handles Jerry's money. He just does my taxes.
Hey Barry, how you doing?
Hey, how are you?
This is my friend George.
Hi George. (shakes George's hand)
Hi, what are you doing on this neighborhood?
Nothing really. (sniffs; looks around) You, eh, you eat here?
Yeah, so how's my money?
Well it's still green. (sniffs twice)
What, you got a cold?
No, no.
Wow, look at that ring.
(showing off the ring to Elaine) Oh, uh you like that? (Elaine not amused gives Barry a polite laugh; Barry sniffs) Say uh, where's the bathroom?
Bathroom uh, bathroom's uh right over there.
(turns looking in the direction Jerry mentioned) Oh, great.
Did you see that?
See what?
Yes, I saw that.
What?
What was all that sniffing?
I don't know.
You don't think...?
Oh, no! Come on Jerry.
He was definitely sniffing.
I mean what if, what if, this this guy has got all my money. Plus he has got some Kramer's money with him. This guy could write checks to himself right out of my account.
No, I have known this guy since college. He doesn't do drugs.
Then, what was all that sniffing?
Maybe it's the cold weather.
Today's not cold.
All right, I gotta get going. My parents are expecting me.
(making fun of George as he leaves) Don't forget to wash your hands before supper.
Why do you need all that ketchup for?
This is my ketchup. I bought this ketchup just so I could have as much as I want.
So I, I talked to Phil Casacof today.
Phil Casacof?
Yeah, you know my friend, the bra salesman. He says they are looking maybe to put somebody on so I got you an interview next Friday with his boss.
Next Friday, what time?
2 o'clock.
That's my whole afternoon! I was going to look for sneakers.
You can look for sneakers the next day!
He doesn't know anything about bras.
I know a little. Besides, what do you have to know?
Well, it wouldn't hurt to go in the and be able to discuss it intelligently. Maybe you should take a look at a few bras? (to Estelle) Where is you bra? Give him a bra to look.
I am not giving him a bra.
Why not?
Because I don't need him looking at my bra.
Why, so he'll go to the interview and he wouldn't know what he's talking about!?!
Do we have to...?
You don't even know what they're made from.
They are made from lycra-spandex.
Get out of here! Lycra-spandex?
I think they are made from lycra-spandex.
Wanna bet? How much you wanna bet?
I'm not betting!
Take a look.
All right, I'll get a bra.
(Yelling to Estelle as she leaves)I don't know what the big problem is getting a bra?!
She doesn't want to get a bra.
I'm not saying go to the library and read the whole history, but it wouldn't kill you to know a little bit about it.
All right, it wouldn't kill me.
How long it takes to find a bra? What's going on in there? You ask me to get a pair of underwear, I'm back in two seconds...you know about the uh cup sizes and all? They have different cups.
Yea I-I know about the cups.
You got the A, the B, the C and the D. That's the biggest.
I know the D is the biggest. I've based my whole life on knowing that the D is the biggest.
Here, here's the bra.
Let me see it.
(reading the bra) 100% lycra-spandex.
Let me see it.
I told you. Here, think you know everything?
Hmm, that's surprising. All right, what else? You got the cups in the front, two loops in the back. All right, a guess that's about it.
I got it. Cups in the front, loops in the back. (puts the bra on the table)
You got ketchup on it!
Sniffing, what do you mean sniffing?
Sniffing, with his nose.
Jerry, he probably had a cold.
No, I asked him.
So, what are you saying?
I don't know, you know, what if...?
Drugs? You think he's on drugs?
I don't know.
Jerry
All I know he was sniffing.
Listen, we went in on a CD together.
I know.
And Newman gave you money too. So, I didn't even meet this guy. You know, we trusted you.
Look, it doesn't necessarily mean anything yet, it just means he was sniffing.
Well, what else? Was he nervous? Did he use a lot of slang? Did he use the word 'man'?
No, he didn't use 'man'.
I mean when he was leaving did he say "I'm splittin'"?
No, but in one point he did use the bathroom.
Whoh!
Do you think that's a bad sign?
Yes!! Yes, that's what they do! They live in the bathroom! All right, what are we going to do? We are going to get our money back, right?
I don't know. (takes off his sweater) This sweater really itches me. You want it?
(grabbing the sweater) Yeah.
Hello.... hello, oh...
Well, you notice anything?
You have cleaned out the whole apartment and you're making dinner. You're perfect, you're a perfect man.
Ooh...
Did anyone call?
You got a few messages, I wrote them down.
Where are they?
Lets see, they are (looking for the paper; finds it; hands it to Elaine) here they are.
Thank you. (looking at the messages) Oh ya, heh, I'll call you back. Ooh, Myra had the baby! Oh, my God that's wonderful! Who called?
She did.
She did? Oh, that's so great!
Where do you keep the corkscrew?
In the drawer on the right. Hmm...
What?
Nah it's nothing.
What is it?
It's nothing.
Tell me.
Well, I was just curious why you didn't use an exclamation point?
What are you talking about?
See, right here you wrote "Myra had the baby", but you didn't use an exclamation point.
So?
So, it's ya nothing. Forget it, forget it, I just find it curious.
What's so curious about it?
Well, I mean if one of your close friends had a baby and I left you a message about it, I would use an exclamation point.
Well, maybe I don't use my exclamation points as haphazardly as you do.
You don't think that someone having a baby warrants an exclamation point.
Hey look, I just chalked down the message. I didn't know I was required to capture the mood of each caller.
I just thought you would be a little more excited about a friend of mine having a baby.
Ok, I'm excited. I just don't happen to like exclamation points.
Well, you know Jake, you should learn to use them. Like the way I'm talking right now, I would put an exclamation points at the end of all these sentences! On this one! And on that one!
Well, you can put one on this one I'm leaving!
You're out of your mind you know that.
Why?
It's an exclamation point! It's a line with a dot under it.
Well, I felt a call for one.
A call for one, you know I thought I've heard everything. I've never heard a relationship being affected by a punctuation.
I found it very troubling that he didn't use one.
George was right. Didn't take you long.
Anything new with that guy on drugs?
Oh, he's not on drugs.
Then why the sniffing? Who walks around (sniff, sniff) sniffing?
All right, here, you call him right now. See if he's sniffing right now.
Good idea. (Jerry calls Barry's office)
Prophet and Goldstein.
Yes, I'd like to speak to Barry Prophet, please.
I'm sorry he's out of town this week.
Out of town?
Yes, he went to South America.
South America?
South America?
I'll call back, thank you. (hangs up the phone) He went to South America!
Yyyeeaaah!!
So what?
Who goes to South America?
People go to South America.
Yeah, and they come back with things taped to they're large intestine.
So, because of a few bad apples you're gonna impugn an entire continent?
Yes, I'm impugning a continent.
Well, I say we're going to take our money right now!
Hey, hey...
Hello Newman.
Hello Jerry. (to Kramer) So, any news?
Yeah, he skipped out and *ptruut* went to South America!
South America?! (to Jerry) What kind of snow blower you get us mixed up with?
Look it, gentlemen. The fact remains you still have no proof. This is all speculation and hearsay.
Wait, there is one way to find out. We set up a sting. You know like Abscam. Like Abscam Jerry.
Ohh, what are you gonna do? You gonna put on phony beards and dress-up like Arab sheiks and sit around in some hotel room. I mean come on...
Wait a second. Maybe there is someway we can tempt him and find out...
If we put our three heads together we should come up with something.
What's today?
It's Thursday.
Really? Feels like Tuesday.
Tuesday has no feel. Monday has a feel, Friday has a feel, Sunday has a feel....
I feel Tuesday and Wednesday...
All right, shut up the both of you! You're making me nervous. Where is he already? He should've been out of work by now.
Hey, you know this is kind of fun.
Yeah, maybe we oughta become private detectives...
Yeah maybe you should.
Maybe I will.
Yeah, me too.
All right, what are you gonna say to him?
Just gonna find out if he's interested.
Hey, hey maybe I should go with him?
No, you stay here in the car.
Who made you the leader?
All right Newman, one more peep outta you, you're out of the whole operation!
Alright.
There he is. He's going into that bar.
All right, I'm going in.
Be careful Kramer.
I shoulda gone in with him.
No, you stay here in the car. I may need you.
What you need me in the car for?
I might need you to get me a soda.
I'll have a brewsky, Charlie.
The name's Mitch.
Oh, there's nothing like a cold one after a long day, eh?
Yeah.
Oh yeah, I've been known to drink a beer or two. But then again, I've been known to do a lot of things. (Waiter opens the counter which hits Kramer on the head) Cigarette?
(sniffs) No, I never touch them.
I suck'em down like Coca-Cola. Well here's to feeling good all the time. (Kramer drinks the beer and smokes the cigarette at the same time. Barry sniffs) Looks like you've got yourself a little cold there, eh fella?
I don't think so.
Me neither.
You should try this new dental floss Glide, it's fantastic.
I use dental tape.
You should try this.
I don't wanna.
Not even once?
No.
You're an idiot.
Why, because I use dental tape?
Right, anyone who uses dental tape is an idiot.
South America?
Yeah, yeah.
Well that's a burgeoning continent.
Well, they are expanding their economic base.
Tell me about it.
(sniffs) Excuse me, I gotta goto the bathroom.
I'm hip.
Hip to the what?
To the whole scene. (sniff)
What scene?
The bathroom scene. (moves his knows as you would if you sniffed)
Listen, don't take this personally, but when I'm coming back I'm sitting over there.
What ever turns you on.
No, no I don't like it.
What do you mean you don't like it? How could you not like it?
I like the thick tape.
Heeyy!! What kind of a nut are you?
So, basically George the job here is quite simple. Selling bras.
Well, that interests me very much Mr. Farkus.Very much indeed, sir.
Have you ever sold a woman's line before?
No, but um I have very good report with women, very good, comfortable. And from the first time I laid eyes on a brassieres, I was enthralled.
Hum. tell me about it.
Well, I was 14 years old. I was in my friends bathroom. His mother's brassieres were hanging on the shower rod and I picked it up, studied it. I thought, I like this. I didn't know what way or what level, but I knew I wanted to be around brassieres.
That's an incredible story. You have a remarkable passion for brassieres.
Well, they're more than an underwear to me Mr. Farkus. Two cups in the front, two loops in the back. How do they do it?
Well, I think I can say, barring some unforeseen incident, that you will have a very bright future here at E.D. Granmont.
Thank you Mr.Farkus, thank you very much indeed sir.
See you monday 9 o'clock.
If you don't mind, sir. I'll be here at 8.
Excellent.
So long, Mr. Farkus.
What you're think you're doing?
Oh, nothing...
Farkus, get out here!
Yes, Ms. De Granmont?
Farkus, who is this pervert little weasel?
Uh, this is Costanza, he's our new bra salesman. (George's offers his hand to shake) He's supposed to start on monday.
If he's here on monday, you're not. Take a pick.
(to George) Get out! (to Ms. De Granmont) I'm terribly sorry Ms. De Granmont...
You wanted to see me, Mr. Lippman?
I was just uh going over the Jake Jarmel book and I understand you worked with him very closely on this.
Yes (clears her throat) yes I did.
And uh, anyway I was just reading your final edit and um, there seems to be an inordinate number of exclamation points.
Uh well um, I felt that the writing lacked certain emotion and intensity.
Ah, (reads an excerpt) "It was damp and chilly afternoon, so I decided to put on my sweatshirt!"
Right, well...
You put exclamation point after sweatshirt?
That's that's correct, I-I felt that the character doesn't like to be ch-ch-chilly...
I see, (reads another excerpt) "I pulled the lever on the machine, but the Clark bar didn't come out!" Exclamation point?
Well, yeah, you know how frustrating that can be when you keep putting quarters and quarters in to machine and then (prrt) nothing comes out...
Get rid of the exclamation points...
Ok, ok ok ...
I hate exclamation points...
...ok I'll just....
'Dear Barry. Consider this letter to be official termination of our relationship effective immediately.'
Exclamation point.
You still have no proof.
Elaine, he was sniffing like crazy around me.
'I will expect all funds in form of cashier checks no later than the 18th'.
Double exclamation point!
Will that take care of ours too?
Yeah, I'll give you yours as soon as I get my money back.
Hey, you want me to mail it? I'm on my way out anyway.
Yeah, thanks.
It'll be my pleasure.
See'ya later.
You know this...
Hey, Ralph.
Hi Ralph.
What's up fellas? That'll be 14.30.
All right.
Mushrooms, you got mushrooms Jerry?
Yeah.
What's the matter? You've got a cold?
No man (sniffs again) Kramer, what is this?
It's a sweater.
What is it made out of?
I don't know, Jerry gave it to me.
Mohair, I think.
Mohair, that figures, I'm allergic to mohair.
You mean you just started sniffing?
Yeah, mohair does it to me every time.
I was wearing that sweater in the coffee shop when Barry came in.
Jerry, I was wearing it in the bar.
The sweater! The sweater made him sniff! See, I told you he wasn't a drug addict.
Oh no! The letter, Newman, it's got exclamation points all over it!
Not to mention the picture of him on the toilet.
The what??
After you.
Thank you.
Get your hands off of me! Johnny!!! Johnny!
What do you mean you felt the material? What, with your fingers like this?
So what, what is so bad about that?
Who goes around feeling people's material? What can be gained by feeling a person's material? It's insanity!
What ever happened to "Why, that's a lovely dress you have on. May I have this dance?"!!
You are really lucky Newman never mailed that letter.
Sorry I'm late, I just came from a meeting with my lawyer.
What is this?
It's a letter from your friend Barry Prophet's lawyer.
He is filing a chapter eleven. Why, what's going on, why is he filing a chapter eleven?
Bankruptcy, bankruptcy...as in I've taken your money and spent it on drugs!
What do you mean, I thought it was the sweater.
All right, What about the money?
What about the money? Apparently if I had dissolved my relationship with him prior to his filing chapter eleven, I've could've got the money back. Which I would've done, if a certain imbecile had been able to get to a mailbox and mail a letter!!
Pair of bear claws, please.
Nice.
Think so?
Yeah, what is it?
Half silk, half cotton, half linen. How can you go wrong?
...And then baby's head comes out, and I'm screaming and my brother who's been videotaping the whole thing turns green, his eyes roll up in his head and he blacks out, he drops the camera, the camera breaks, and then, the placenta comes flying out.
Whoa.
And then doctor says...
(interrupting) Thanks, that's enough.
Will you look at that kid. Sucking away. Sucking like there's no tomorrow. Suck, suck, suck...
(Looking away) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Look at that Jerry, look at that. Sucking, sucking...
Yeah, I looked. I saw.
This doesn't make you uncomfortable, does it?
No, Uncomfortable? Not at all. (ASIDE TO ELAINE) My friend's wife's breast sticking out - why would that make me uncomfortable?
Look at him.
So how long do they do this?
Jus, a year or two.
No break?
After that comes the weaning.
So after the sucking, comes the weaning.
First the sucking then the weaning.
Well, you gotta wean.
Gotta wean.
Must wean.
What about that spot I got?
Yeah, I saw the spot.
You open the door to the car, boom, you walk right into the hospital. Eh, You can't beat that spot. (starts doing a little dance) I am on a roll. I'm just willing these great parking spots.
George...
Maybe the baby would like to see my spot. A positive, uplifting message to start his life out with. Huh, You can still get a great space in this city - if you apply yourself.
(to Elaine) Where's Kramer? Shouldn't he be here by now.
Did you give him the room number?
Ya, 1397.
1937, 1937, 1937...
Excuse me. Do you know where the elevator is?
Uh ya, it's right around the corner there.
1937
Oh! God, It's a Pig man! A pig man!
..So anyway, Jerry, Elaine, we have something we want to ask you.
You gotta look at this. I pulled it in perfectly equidistant from the car in front of me and the car behind me.
Will you shut up George.
I'm taking a cab home. I can't this anymore.
You were saying Stan? I-I'm sorry about that.
Myra and I would like you and Elaine to be the Godparents of Steven.
Huuh, Wow.
Me? Godfather?
Yes.
(a la "Don Corleone") Never go against the family, Elaine.
What?
Hey, I just saw a pig man! A pig man! Ya know he was sleeping and then he woke up and he looked up at me an-and he made this horrible sound, this (Quells like a pig).
Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?
I'm talking about the pig man. I went into the wrong room and there he was.
A pig-man?
A pig-man. Half pig, half man!
That's great Kramer... So-So, anyway, tell us what's involved in being a Godparent.
(a la "Don Corleione") Elaine, never ask me about my business!.... (SHEEPISH) "Godfather."
The most important thing is you help with the bris.
The bris?
A bris? You mean circumcision?
Ya.
I would advise against that.
Wha, Kramer. It's a tradition.
Ya well, so was uh sacrificing virgins to appease the gods, but we don't do that anymore.
Well, maybe we should.
(knocks on the window) Hey, why are all those people milling around my car?
I don't know.
Maybe they're admiring your spot.
They're all looking up.
Hey, there's a guy up the roof.
Whoa. That's the guy that I told where the elevator was.
Oh well, I hope he doesn't jum...
Oh my!
My car! My caaaaarrrr!
A Mohel! What the hell is a Mohel?
A Mohel is the person that performs the circumcision.
Where am I going to find a Mohel? (LOOKING THROUGH THE YELLOW PAGES, MUTTERING) Motels, models... How do you find a Mohel?
Oh, finding a Mohel is a piece of cake. Any idiot can find a Mohel. I have to hold the baby while they do it. That's a tough job. How would you like that?
Hey Jerry, you ever seen one?
You mean that wasn't uh.
Yeah.
No.. you?
Ya.
What'd you think?
(shakes her head) No, had no face, no personality. It was like a martian. But hey, you know that's me.
Hey.
Well I just got the estimate. It's going to cost more to fix that roof than the car's worth, So I'm going over to see that hospital administrator today. Someone is gonna pay for this damage and it's not gonna be me.
Ah, you're screwed.
I know, swan dives from twenty floors up, lands right on top. What do I got a bulls eye up there? He couldn't move over two feet? Land on the sidewalk. It's city property.
Well I have to interview a Mohel.
How about our little Elaine huh? Attended the finest finishing schools on the Eastern seaboard. Equestrian competitions. Debutante balls. Look at her now. Interviewing Mohels.
YEA!
What's the matter?
Are you alright?
Don't even question my instincts, because my instincts are honed. (REPAPER) Look at that.
What now?
Look look.
(Kramer shows Jerry and Elaine the paper) "Hospital receives grant to conduct DNA research".." Government funds genetic research at area hospital" ... Yeah, so?
pig-man, baby. pig-man.
If I hear about this pig-man one more time...
Hey, I'm tellin ya the pig-man is alive. The government has been experimenting with pig-men since the fifties.
Oh, will you stop it. Just because a hospital studying DNA research doesn't mean they're creating a race of mutant pig-men!
Jerry wake up to reality. It's a military thing. They're probably creating a whole army of pig warriors.
I tell you something. I wish there were pig-men. You get a few of these pig-men walking around suddenly I'm looking a whole lot better. Then if somebody wants to fix me up at least they could say, "Hey he's no pig-man!"
Believe me, there'd be plenty of women going for these pig-men. Whatever the deformity is there's always some group of perverts that's attracted to it. "Oo that little tail really turns me on."
(MUMBLES) That's just about enough
Oh, what's the matter this doesn't interest you?
Oh, no, it's fascinating, but could you do me a favor, could ya tape the rest of the pig-men and the women who love them discussion and I'll listen to it the next time I'm here. I've gotta go find a Mohel.
You know, you should call this off, Elaine. It's a barbaric ritual.
Well, perhaps one day when the pig-men roam free it will be stopped Kramer. Until then, off with their heads.
But Kramer, isn't it a question of hygiene?
It's a myth. Besides, it makes sex more pleasurable.
Yeah. So how does that help me?
(TO GEORGE) Hey George, you ever see one?
Yeah, my roommate in college.
So what'd you think?
(thinks for a second) I got used to it.
Alright, I'm waiting. I-I want to see the pig-man. Show me the pig- man.
Oh, don't worry. I'm gonna show you, and you'll never be the same.
Maybe he's just a guy with a nose like this. (holds his nose up like a pig) You know a lot of people have a nose like this, they're not necessarily pig-men.
Believe me, Jerry, somewhere in this hospital the anguished "oink" of pig-man cries out for help.
Well, if I hear an anguished "oink", I'm outta here. I-I don't see any pig-men. Look (HE POINTS AT PASSERBY) Human, human, human... (HE LOOKS DOWN CORRIDOR, WITH ALARM.) (WITH MOCK ALARM) Wait a second! (Grabs Kramer)
What?!
Oh, it's George.
Alright the administrator's on the third floor. I'll meet you guys back at the car.
Wait wait George. You got room in the car for the pig-man huh?
The pig-man can take the bus.
George, if the pig-man had a car, he would give you a ride.
How do you know? What if pig-man had a two-seater?
Be realistic George.
I'll tell you what, if pig-man shows up, we'll squeeze him in. I'll see you later.
Yea.
Mr. Costanza, come in, come in. It's been a very trying couple of days around the hospital. Doctors, patients, everyone, just grief stricken over this unfortunate occurrence.
Well, I join them in their grief.
Horrible thing. Flew right past the children's wing. All the sick children, in the playroom, looking out the window, just traumatized by the incident. Apparently, they thought he was flying. You know how children are, "Oh look. A man is flying. A man is flying" And then, splat...
That's where I come in. Umm, on splat. Uh, you see, Mrs. Sweedler, or is it hospital administrator Sweedler?
Mrs. Sweedler's fine.
Mrs. Sweedler thank you. Y-You see, this tragedy affected me in a very, very personal way.
How is that?
Yes, well you see, the deceased landed on my car. The uh splat, as it were, actually occurred on the roof of my car. Now of course I can't help but feel that had it been a convertible this whole tragedy might have been averted but I've never been the kind of guy to buy a convertible, what with the baldness and everything.
Well I have known bald men who owned convertibles. They wore a hat.
Yes but then everything is all pulled down and it's jus.. Anyway. The damage, unfortunately, has marred an otherwise fine automobile, rendering it virtually undriveable.
(STIFFENING) Yes, well, that is a shame.
Yes, a shame. That is exactly how I would put it. Now Mrs. Sweedler, with all due discretion and sensitivity, and taking in the whole scope of the situation, I just can't help but think that, the hospital is somehow responsible for compensating the other, still living 'victim' of horrendous, horrendous tragedy.
Mr.Constanza.
Yes.
A man plummeted tragically to his ultimate demise -
Yes.
... and you greedily, callously want to profit from it?
(PULLING OUT ESTIMATE OUT OF HIS POCKET) Well, profit. I think you'll see from the estimate that I'm not really profiting that much. They might be a little high, but..
Get out! Get out, now! Get out of my office.
Should I leave this..?
GET OUT!
Excuse me. What happened to the man, that was in this room before?
I don't know what you're talking about.
You know. (HE PUSHES HIS NOSE UP WITH HIS THUMB).
No.
(STILL HOLDING HIS NOSE UP ) This doesn't look familiar to you?
Uh, Sir?
Look, I know what's going on. The oink, oink.
Yes well if you'll excuse me. I really have some patients I have to attend to.
(TOUGH TALKING) Now listen to me you little quack, There was a half man, half pig in that room over there. Now where is he?! Where is he?!
Half-what?
You know what I mean - pork, sausage, (A LA PORKY PIG) A-deek-a-deek-a- deek th-th-th-that's all folks.
I think he's been released.
He's lying.
Alright Kramer, enough of this. Let's go find George.
Alright you go ahead.
Kramer.
Where's the Mohel?
He'll be here.
He's late already.
Relax. You'd think you were getting whacked.
I don't know why he asked me to be the Godfather. We're not even that close of friends. Just cause we're on the softball team, I'm the pitcher, he's the catcher he thinks we have a special relationship?
I thought pitchers and catchers did have a special rapport.
Well maybe in hardball with all the signals and everything but I'm just lobbing it in. We don't have any conferences. He doesn't come out to the mound and encourage me.
What about me? I mean I just watched a few games with her sitting in the stands.
Don't they have any closer friends. They're level jumping on our friendship.
Yes it is level jumping.
So uh... been to a bris before?
No.
I've been to a few of em. If you uh start to get woozy later, which is quite common, stay close to me. I'll get you through it. (chuckles)
I'm a cardiologist. I think I'll manage.
Oh.
We're not talking about a manicure. Imagine, this is going to be his first memory. Of his parents just standing there while some stranger (Does some motions of cutting; Myra sobs more) cutting off a piece of his manhood and then serves a catered lunch.
(Seeing Myra run away sobbing) Myra?
Kramer, what's the matter with you?
Me?
(to everyone) Oh, that's the Mohel.
