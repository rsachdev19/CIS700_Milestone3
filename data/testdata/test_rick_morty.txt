Sir, I need to get to the stage and help Rick get schwifty!
It won’t matter how schwifty you get, Morty. The General’s got nukes set to launch halfway through Earth’s song!
Oh my God! C-c-can you fly a Blackhawk?
Can the Pope’s dick fit through a donut?
Uhhh, I’m not sure?
Exactly!
SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT.
Ahem.  Uhhh… lop-oo-lop-oo-lop-oo-dups, nop-oo-nop-oo-nop-oo-nuts.
Headward free now to rise!
Hey! Look at the heads! Looks like the heads are gettin’ angry!
I’m really bad at this, Morty! There are way too many buttons on this thing!
Mr. President, if I’ve learned one thing today, it’s that sometimes, you have to not give a fuck!
Nup-oo-nup-oo-nup-oo-nups… ooh, tough crowd.
I’m sure that has… that has nothing to do with this.
The heads are displeased!
Morty!
The heads love this! They love it when we DON’T kill the Smith family!
No! Stop that! You’re not allowed to interpret the will of the heads!
Call off the nuclear strike! This is the President. Stop the nuclear missile launch!
Just launch the missiles!
BOO! NOT COOL!
I’m the only one that speaks to the heads!
DISQUALIFIED!
The heads disqualified Vagina! Get him!
DISQUALIFIED! DISQUALIFIED!
That’s right, it’s me, Ice-T! I care now! You made me care more! With all due respect, I’d like to hear what Rick and Morty have to play.
What do you say, Rick?
I say…  Let’s do it!
All right!
Ohhhh yeahhhh!
Come on, here we go!
Ohhhh yeahhhh!
Say it with me!
Ohhh my GOOOOODDDD!!!
After 988 seasons of Planet Music, the Cromulons have decided to declare Earth the final winner and bring our musical reality show to a conclusion. Goodbye!
Did he just say “musical reality show”?
Yeah, it’s possible that we may have been correlating some things that weren’t actually related at all.
HEEEEELLLLPPPP!!!!!
We should go get him.
I hope I can call on you again if we need you, Morty.
Sure thing! And I was kinda hoping that I could get a selfie with you?
Actually, if you try to tell anyone what happened here, we’ll deny it and probably worse.
Understood.
DIIIIEEEE!!!!
Why didn’t he turn into a snake?
Trade secret, Mr. President. Particle beam in a wristwatch… snake holster on the leg.
I love this man!
Magnesium-J, Hydrogen-F. Father.
I have changed. I am ready to rejoin my brethren on Alphabetrium.
Don't worry about Jerry. He's gonna be fine.You hear me Jerry? You're gonna be fine!
Woahh!
ooo... Watch out for that stuff. It'll stain if it gets on your clothes, and it'll send into a murderous rage if it gets in your eyes or mouth.
Why would you keep mutant bacteria in a pint of Cherry Garcia?
I know this isn't the time, but, you know, technically the second freezer drawer is mine.
Not anymore.
You're overreacting!
Alright fine, but you're not touching my CRISPR.
Is he going to die?
What? Every hospital claims to have the best doctor in the galaxy. It's like those pizza places that claim to have the best pizza in the world. What- Do you think they have pizza contests? Have you ever been to a pizza contest?
Go in the waiting room, Dad.
Fine!  Excuse me. Coming through. What are you here for- Just kidding, I don't care. Well this won't do.
A sequel.
Yeah me neither, we pretty much nailed it the first time.
Eye-holes! Get them today! IKEA.
You gotta be careful Morty, if that guy catches you with a box of his eye-holes he comes bursting in through a window and just starts kicking the shit outta you. But it's worth the risk, they melt in your mouth Morty! They're delicious.
I can't believe you're explaining alien cereal, we're worried about Jerry.
Well you're thirty-nine years too late, or however old he is. Is he fifty? Oh man, Beth is, is Jerry fifity!?
Where am I?
Relax Mr. Smith, you're in an alien hospital. I mean to you it's an alien hospital, to me you're just in a hospital. There's another matter we need to discuss with you.
My goodness.
I see-WAIT! What?
It's perfect! The configuration of veins, the ratio of thickness to elasticity, the delicate asymmetry of what you call "your balls". With relatively few adjustments, your genitals can be molded into a working heart for the most important man in the universe!
Yeah, but, I mean-
Alright! That's enough. You're talking about my species! We understand genocide, we do it sometimes!
Yes I will! That's right, assholes, take my penis, TAKE IT ALL! And tell Shrimply Pimples that when the galaxy came calling Jerry Smith from Earth didn't flinch!
Hey, what's wrong Morty? Oh, you're worried about your dad, huh?
Huh? Uh, no no no, I'm-I'm just looking at that lady getting coffee. What's up with her face? Is she a human or is she like Worf. You know Worf, from Star Trek, where he has the shit all over his face but he's just a human in a costume, you know?
Morty let's-let's see what else is on.
Okay.
Whoa! Look! It's that lady with all that shit on her face like Worf from Star Trek! That was getting coffee! How did she get there!
Oh, man Morty. How DID she get there?
Is that something we should be concerned about?
Just stay away from the coffee machine.
In a world, where there are eight Jan-Michael Vincent's.
And sixteen quadrants. There's only enough time for a Jan-Michael Vincent to make it to a quadrant. He can't be in two quadrants at once.
Rick, who-who is Jan-Michael Vincent?
Oh man, I'm trying to remember Morty.
Jan-Michael Vincent's are used up.
Is it important that we know who Jan-Michael Vincent is in order to get this?
Nope.
This January, It's time to Mike down your Vincent's. Jan Quadrant Vincent 16.
That's Jan-Michaels.
Excuse me, nurse, can you take my temperature? Because I think I have Jan Quadrant Vincent fever over here.
All right, Morty you've done it!
So, we'll be detaching your sexual organ at the base by making incisions here,here, and here.
Got it.
Leaving a partial length of severed urethra to be threaded through-
Oh, you know what, I gotta laugh at myself here! I'm having a little laugh at myself because I just realized I haven't run this whole decision past my wife.
Oh, do you think she'll be okay with this?
Oh, absolutely. Beth is automatically on board, always, with every decision I make.
Smith family?
Yes?
I wanted to let you all know that Jerry is doing just fine.
But, ah, Mrs. Smith, could you come with me?
Hi, honey, so, here's the thing-these guys-they want to completely remove my penis and use it as an alien's heart, and we just need you to sign off on it.
WHAT!?!
Uh-oh, maybe we have a problem here after all guys. Yikes.
His penis will be replaced with a sophisticated prosthetic, now there's a wide range of options to chose from, they're all in this catalog.
I don't care about prosthetics, this is insane! What do you people think you're doing?
I understand your feelings, Mrs. Smith.
Oh, I don't think you do. I bring my husband in for emergency medical treatment, he's gone an hour, and now you want his PENIS, and you hand me some... catalog. It's--It's--It's--It's, I mean.
Sheesh, well, there you go. Sorry. I know it's hard to understand but on Earth, love comes first.
There are those that believe, Mr. Smith, that Shrimply Pibbles represents love between all life. That his fate will determine the fate of hundreds of billions of sentient life forms.
Woah! Woah. So, billions of life forms?
Hundreds of billions.
I mean, Jerry, y-you didn't explain the full gravity of the situation.
Uh, well, Beth, I don't think your decision should be based on politics. Who could argue with a wife's decision to keep her LOVER INTACT.
Well I don't think that's fair at all, Jerry. At all. In fact, I think this whole paradigm has sexist overtones.
Beth, can we talk about this privately?
You know, I think, the bottom line is, Jerry, if you want to keep your penis, you should say, out loud, "I prefer to keep my penis."
But, Beth, what kind of man would say something like that if the universe needed his penis!?!
Well, Jerry, what kind of wife would I be if I did anything to stand in your way?
Anyway, that's how I escaped from space prison! Oh, scary place.
Wow, Rick! That's -- That's one -- one heck of a story. I sure do wish I could have been there to see it happen.
Oh, come on. Who wants to watch a mad scientist use handmade sci-fi tools to take out highly trained alien guards when we can sit here and be a family at Shoney's?
Dad, it's great to have you back, no matter where we are, but wouldn't you like to go home?
Emotionally speaking, honey, Shoney's is my home.
Yeah, but you just got out of prison. I mean, how much of a step up from that is --
Jerry, get out of the booth, take all your clothes off, and fold yourself 12 times.
You got it.
Six folds, huh? W-W-What, have you guys got me in a Series 9000? You cheap insect fucks didn't think I was worth your best equipment?
Man, I told the money bugs. I said, "You know who this guy is, right? You want me to get intel out of the smartest mammal in the galaxy, you better give me a decent brainalyzer.
Well, you might as well order some pancakes, because I don't see the need to leave this part of my brain.
Oh, I think you do. Eventually, you're either gonna relax your cerebellum.
Shoney's.
Or the Series 9000 is going to turn it into mush.
Relaxed enough?
I admire you, Rick--
When I--
Rick, here's--
I tell ya, the Galactic Federation taking over Earth -- best thing that's ever happened to this family. I just got my sixth promotion this week, and I still don't know what I do.
Who cares how high they promote you? Everyone just gets paid in pills.
Well, when you're not sure what you do for a living, you can make your own rules.
Summer, show your father some respect. He's pulling down a six-chewable figure income.
I kind of had big pills for lunch, and I  wasn't gonna eat any more pills.  Thank you, Conroy.
You spoil us, Conroy.
Grandpa Rick wouldn't put up with this!
Stop saying his name! He abandoned us.
Willem Dafoe! Th-That's the guy I couldn't think of this morning.
Don't make my mistake, Summer. Don't deify the people that leave you. You'll end up a horse surgeon in a world controlled by aliens whose medicine keeps horses  healthy forever.  Horses live longer than tortoises now. Is that what you want for yourself?
Maybe I just want you to care if I run away yelling!
Ooh!
Oh, any particular ones? You want to see my first boner, or should we go straight to the moment I discovered interdimensional travel?
' Ooh, your little flappy doodles are twitching. Does that mean you're aroused, or did you just get a signal that one of your buddies found a grape?
It's arousal. Yes, I'd like very much to visit the memory of you inventing your portal gun.
Yeah, well, tough titties.
Well, that depends on who breaks first -- me or the titty.
Someone special you remember? Is that your memory of her out there -- between where you were on 9/11 and your favorite sports blooper?
If we stay here, you'll die, along with all your memories. If you take me where I want to go she'll be there, too, won't she?
The day I invented the portal gun is the day I lost her.
Oh, that sounds cool. I can get what I want and you can say goodbye.
Fine, but I'm driving.
Huh? What are you -- What are you doing?
Grandpa Rick must have some secret lab, right? With, like, laser guns and jets packs and a space tank! And we can go break him out of prison! Look at these dead flies! Maybe if we arrange them in a certain order, it plays a hologram or it opens a secret door.
Summer, you're freaking me out. I know things have changed a lot, and I know you miss Rick, but getting him back wouldn't make things better. And, you know, we're not doing so bad.
We're miserable, Morty! There's a mandatory curfew, their weird calendar made me 47, and they weaponized the Eiffel Tower!
Hey, I like being 35. I-I can rent a car now.
Because you suck! You've been keeping your lip zipped about it since Grandpa got arrested, but the fact is, you're freaking stoked to bail on him.
He bails on everybody! He bailed on Mom when she was a kid! He -- He bailed on tiny planet! And in case I never made this clear to you, Summer, he bailed on you. He left you to rot in a world that he ruined because he doesn't care! Because nobody's special to him, Summer, not even himself. So, if you really want your grandpa back, grab a shovel. The one that won't let you down is buried in your backyard!
You're right!
What?! No, I'm not right. I-I was using ghoulish overkill! Ghoulish overkill, Summer!
Oh, God! Oh, God! Whoa, whoa!
Where are we going?
To the day it all began and ended. The moment that changed everything.
Yeah, I'd like to get a 10-piece McNugget and a bunch of the Szechuan sauce. Like, as much as you're allowed to give me. In 1998, they had this promotion for the Disney film "Mulan," where they -- where they -- they created a new sauce for the McNuggets called Szechuan sauce, and it's delicious! And then they got rid of it, and now it's gone. This is the only place we're gonna be able to try it, is in my memory.
Rick, you're doing this bit while your brain is melting.
Okay. All right, all right.
Is that--
Me. I used to wear blue pants.
When'd you make the leap to interdimensional travel?
I didn't. I did.
What?
Summer, nobody has to know about that. We could put it right back and pretend we never saw it, like we did with Dad's mannequin leg.
Fine, stay here. I'll rescue Grandpa myself.
And how are you gonna do that?
I don't know yet. I'll make it up as I go. That's what Grandpa Rick does. That's what heroes do.
Y-You want to see what a hero Rick is? I-I'll bring you somewhere, Summer. Um-
What is this place? And what's with "Hunger Games" Summer?
That's my sister. This used to be my home.
Sounds lonely.
Eh, pass.
A different kind of Rick, I guess.
Sort of. I just took a long look at myself, and I don't think this science thing is gonna pay off.
That, Dianne, is the last great idea that will ever be had in this garage.
Good roasted Cronenberg, I assume. Mom, you're looking feral. I can't believe Rick did this.
These are the parts of Rick's adventures you don't get to see -- the parts he leaves behind. All right, it's been great, guys. I really only wanted to stop by here for a quick "I told ya so." So, uh--
What are you doing with that?!
No! Why?! Why would you do that?! W-W-What is the matter with you people?!
Hold your fire! Hold your fire! I'm Morty C-137.
He's in prison.
Summer.
He got captured by the Federation and we were going to rescue him.
Boo-yah!
Boo-nah?
Come on, girls! The ice cream's gonna melt.
Nooooooo!
Wow. This sauce is fucking amazing. You said it was promoting a movie?
Carry the three, add a two. I got it. I fucking got it.
Whoa. I-Is that it, the portal gun?
Yeah. That's the three lines of math that separates my life as a man from my life as an unfeeling ghost.
Awesome-possum.  Mission Control, you getting this?
Yeah! Thanks, Rick. I'll try to remember to shut off the brainalyzer. Actually, I think it shuts off automatically once your brain is liquid. Don't know, don't care. Pull me out.  Hey, pull me out! Can you hear me?
Nope, they cannot.
Why not?
Because the code you just uploaded wasn't actually my portal-gun formula, it was a virus giving me full control over the brainalyzer.
What are you talking about? This is a memory. Y-You can't alter details of a memory.
True, but you can alter anything you want about a totally fabricated origin story.
It's a trap! Abort! I'm still in his Shoney's! Repeat -- we never left his Shoney's!
Mission accomplished, boys. Pull me out.
Okay, have fun in what's left of my brain. I'm gonna transfer to yours. Oh, there's not enough room for all my genius, so I'm leaving you with my fear of wicker furniture, my desire to play the trumpet, my tentative plans to purchase a hat, and six years of improv workshops. Comedy comes in threes.
It's a trap! Abort! We never left his --   No!
A city of Grandpas?
It's the Citadel of Ricks. All the different Ricks from all the different realities got together to hide here from the government.
But if every Rick hates the government, why would they hate Grandpa?
Because Ricks hate themselves the most. And our Rick is the most himself.
Operating an unregistered portal gun, radicalizing a Summer, conspiring with a traitorous Rick. How do you plead?
How is this a fair trial? O-Our lawyer is a Morty.
It's not fair, you have no rights, and he's not a lawyer. We just keep him here because he's fun. Look at him go.
We'll be lenient if you renounce your Rick. What say you, Summer?
I say fuck you! My grandpa was my hero. You killed him because you were jealous of him. That's pretty obvious from the haircuts. So do what you want to me, but let my brother go. He already renounced Rick.
Morty?
What? N-No, I don't want to see your Pog collection. I don't renounce Rick, and I never have. I was just trying to protect my sister. I wanted you to have a normal life. That's something you can't have when Rick shows up. Everything real turns fake. Everything right is wrong. All you know is that you know nothing and he knows everything. And, well -- well, he's not a villain, Summer, but he shouldn't be your hero. He's more like a demon or a super fucked up god.
Let's not suck the ghost of his dick too hard. He was a terrorist, and now he's dead.
Oh, yeah? If you think my Rick's dead, he's alive. And if you think you're safe, he's coming for you!
All right, calm down! We have his Summer as a hostage. Obviously, I get her. You guys play Rick, Laser, Scissors for the Morty.
Grandpa Rick!
Duh!
You're alive!
Rick!
Morty, take this. You're gonna need it later.
That's enough, Rick.
What -- What's this supposed to accomplish? We have infinite grandkids. You're trying to use Disney bucks at a Caesar's Palace here.
That's a bluff. He's bluffing, sir. He loves me.
You're a rogue Rick -- irrational, passionate. You love your grandkids. You came to rescue them.
I came to kill you, bro. That's not even my original Summer.
Oh, my God. He's not bluffing. He's not bluffing!
R-Rick?
Why not shoot through her?
20 yards, nine-gauge plasma pistol, My first shot would liquify her insides and injure you, second shot adds recoil. The risk to me is minimized if I wait for you to shoot her, which I'm encouraging you to do.
What the fuck?
Or let her go, which I will reward with a quicker death.
Because you love her!
Because it's incentive for you to give me my cleanest shot, which will be your least painful death. But if you want to die slower than that, I'm super into it. All you got to do to get that started is kill the girl.
I hate you!
Not an issue, sweetie.
That's enough! Drop the gun, Rick!
Morty, I know you're too stupid to get this, but you're really fuckin' this up right now.
I'm not letting you let my sister die! Drop the gun!
I wasn't gonna let her die, you fuckin' moron!
Ha!
Aww.
The point is he thought I was going to.
I totally did, by the way. You're a fucking moron, Morty.
Morty, you fucking idiot!
You're a serious fuckin' idiot, Morty! You basically killed us all! You're the worst! You're as dumb as a bag of sand.
Who's stupid now, bitch?!
Morty, we just got him back!
That was amazing, Morty. Oh, my God. Wow. Okay, let's wrap this-
Good job, Morty. Let's go, kids.
What?! What happened?
Oldest Rick trick in the book.
"Fake gun, shoot me in standoff." Brilliant.
Ha, yeah. G-Good thing I saw that note.
Can't we just portal home?
Not until I finish what I started. And that is how you get level-nine access without a password.
Employee of the month, ladies and gentlemen.
So, what are you doing with level-nine access anyways?
Destroying the  galactic government.
Are you going to set all their nukes to target each other?
Ooh, or -- or reprogram their military portals to disintegrate their entire space fleet?
Good pitches, kids. I'm almost proud. But watch closely as Grandpa topples an empire by changing a one to a zero.
No longer will the insects have domain over surface world!
Jerry, what the hell is happening?!
The galactic government collapsed.
Are you okay?
Look, I-I'm not proud to share this, but the truth is, I just kept crawling, and it kept working.  Oh, I'm glad you're okay. Are we ever going to stop paying for indulging your father? Our children, our planet, our jobs? Is there anything left to lose?
Just each other, and I'll never let you go. And I'm so sorry I ever did this to us.
Guess who dismantled the government?
Please don't leave me again.
I never will, baby.
I was right. He turned himself in on purpose. It was all part of his plan!
Jerry, is there any light beer left? It's insane what you miss in prison.
Um..okay. No. No, no, no. Foot down time.
No, you're right. Where's the vodka?
Beth, it's him or me!
Seems like you guys need some privacy. I'll, uh -- I'll be in the garage.
What the fuck? Not cool, Jerry! A man's garage is his castle.
Jerry's going to spend some time divorced.
Oh, I-I'm sorry to hear that, sweetie. I hope I had nothing to do with that.
Oh, God, Dad, that is not your burden to bear. I feel terrible that I misjudged you. This is gonna be good for Jerry.
For everybody.
For everybody.
I better tend to Jerry before he changes his mind and doesn't move out. I will leave you two to your adventures.
Oh, my God. Nancy says they're drawing and quartering aliens in the school courtyard, and it technically counts as patriotism.
Geez! Are my parents seriously gonna get divorced? All right, Rick, I'm gonna go to my --
Not so fast, Morty. You heard your mom. We've got adventures to go on, Morty -- just you and me -- and sometimes your sister and sometimes your mom, but never your dad. You want to know why, Morty? Because he crossed me.
Okay, take it easy, Rick. T-T-That's dark.
Oh, it gets darker, Morty. Welcome to the darkest year of our adventures. First thing that's different -- no more Dad, Morty.
Oh, geez.
He threatened to turn me in to the government, so I made him and the government go away.
Oh, fuck.
I've replaced them both as the de facto patriarch of your family and your universe. Your mom wouldn't have accepted me if I came home -
Oh, man.
- without you and your sister, so now you know the real reason I rescued you. Oh! I just took over the family, Morty, and if you tell your mom -
Oh, man.
- or sister I said any of this, I'll deny it -
You're gonna deny it.
- and they'll take my side because I'm a hero, Morty. And now you're gonna have to go -
Oh.
- and do whatever I say, Morty, forever! And I'll -- I'll go out and I'll find some more of that "Mulan" Szechuan teriyaki dipping sauce, Morty. -
What are you talking about?
- Because that's -- that's what this is all about, Morty.
Szechuan?
That's my one-armed man! I'm not driven by avenging my dead family, Morty! That was fake. I-I-I'm driven by finding that McNugget sauce.
McNuggets?
I want that "Mulan" McNugget sauce, Morty! That's my series arc, Morty.
What the hell?
If it takes nine seasons, I want my McNugget dipping sauce, Szechuan sauce, Morty.
What are you talking about, Rick?
That's what's gonna take us all the way to the end, Morty.
What are you talking about?!
Season -- Nine more seasons, Morty. Nine more seasons until I get that dipping Szechuan sauce.
What is that?!
For 97 more years, Morty!
What are you talking about?!
I want that McNugget sauce, Morty!
I am Phoenixperson.
Morty.
Rick?
Morty!
Rick?
Hey, Mooorty!
Rick? Are you far away, or are you inside something?
Morty, the garage, Morty. Come to the garage!
Morty?
Rick? W-where are you?
On my work bench, Morty.
Are you invisible and you're gonna, like, fart on me?
Flip the pickle over.
What, I'm gonna touch it, and you're gonna tell me it's an alien dick or something.
Come on, flip the pickle, Morty. You're not gonna regret it. The payoff is huge.
And?
"And"? What more do you want tacked on to this? I turned myself into a pickle, and 9/11 was an inside job?
Was it?
Who cares, Morty? Global acts of terrorism happen every day. Uh, here's something that's never happened before
Are you going to, I mean, you know, is this the first part of some magic trick?
I don't do magic, Morty, I do science. One takes brains, the other takes dark eye liner.
Well, can you move? Can you fly?
I wouldn't be much of a pickle if I could.
All right, well, do pickles live forever or --
Morty, stop digging for hidden layers and just be impressed. I'm a pickle.
I-I'm just trying to figure out why you would do this. Why anyone would do this.
The reason anyone would do this is, if they could, which they can't, would be because they could, which they can't.
Morty, we have to get going, or we're gonna be late. Where's your grandpa?
Right here, sweetie. I'm a pickle!
What?! Why would you -- Look, we're running late. We have to go.
Where are you guys going?
We have an appointment downtown that was set a week ago and agreed upon by everyone, including you.
Oh, my God. Beth, oh, it totally slipped my mind. Geez, oh, man. I'm a pickle. I mean, I don't know if I can, ooh, geez.
Rick, did you do this on purpose to get out of family counseling?
Morty!
It's okay, Beth. I understand Morty's suspicion. I've misled him before. Morty, turn me so we're making eye contact.Morty, I assure you, I would never "find a way" to "get out of" family therapy. I hope my lack of fingers doesn't prevent the perception of my air quotes.
Can't you just turn yourself back into a human?
Great question, Summer. The unfortunate answer is I did this to challenge myself. And it could take hours or even days before I'm able to figure out how to return to human form. But, I mean, you know, your mom could put me in a purse or a pocket, you know, if she really needs me to go.
Nobody needs anything! Okay, it's fine. I mean, you should just stay here and figure out how to stop being a pickle, okay?
Hey, Rick, why is there a syringe of mysterious fluid hanging directly over you? Also, why is the string attached to it running through a pair of scissors attached to a timer? And why is the time set to 10 minutes from now, exactly when we would have left for therapy?
Well, Morty, if you know must know, the syringe is completely unrelated to this discussion, and, therefore, it does not warrant further explanation.
Enough. Kids, it's time to go. We don't want to be late.
W-w-what are you doing there, Beth? What are you doing there, sweetie?
Well, I mean, you don't want to get pierced by a needle full of liquid unrelated to your situation. How's that gonna help?
Can't argue with that.
Great. We'll see you later.
Hey, hey, be careful with that. It's for something else. It's really important, so don't break it. Okay, I may have fucked up here. Dup, ap, ap, pap, ut, dah, pap, pap, pap, pah. T-t-tah, tah.  Oh, great. Stupid cat.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I know what it looks like to you, Izzy, but I'm not a snake! I've seen the YouTube videos, I know cats are scared of cucumbers and pickles because they think they're snakes. I'm not a snake! I'm a pickle, I'm a pickle!
Whoa! Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Oh, crap, that sun is bright.
Okay, come on. This can't really be the way I go out. This is the mega-genius equivalent of dying on the toilet.
So... hot. This is how I'm gonna die.
Oh, God, moisture.
Oh, God, the moisture! Dial it back, God! Dial it back a little bit here!
Oh! Oh!
Oh, God! Perpendicular, perpendicular!
Oh, shiiit! Oh! Oh! Oh!
Come on. That's it.
Come get this delicious brine.
Aah! Come on! Come on, motherfucker! Come on!
Yes!
How is this even family therapy if Dad's not invited and Grandpa won't come?
Yeah, and what's courageous about eating a hot dog?
It's nobody's choice to be here, you knobs. The family was told to get counseling by your principal, even though it's not the family that was huffing pottery glaze in the art room and desk wetting in history class.
Oh, the Smith family, minus a dad. You're patients of Dr. Wong, too?
Temporarily. By order of the school.
Me too. How long have you all been eating poop?
We... have never... eaten poop.
Uh, me, neither. Say, where did my family get off to?
Smith family, I'm Dr. Wong. Come on in.
I was told there was a grandpa that might be joining us?
He got wrapped up in an experiment. He's a scientist. Like, legit, like on an inter-galactic, sci-fi level. His work is very --
He turned himself into a pickle.
Morty, Mom's talking. I'm sorry, I suppose that's a good segue into our little discipline cases here.
Does Grandpa turn himself into a pickle a lot?
What? No, what kind of question is that?
The kind that wasn't designed to attack or hurt you in any way.
Oh, Jesus Christ, one of these. No, my father has never turned himself into a pickle before. He's unpredictable and eccentric. The whole family is. Speaking of which...
Okay, let's open things up to the whole family, and let me ask this. Why do we think Grandpa turned himself into a pickle?
Wow. Ugh.
I didn't say my father is perfect, I said his work is important.
And she's saying what's important is that Grandpa lied to you to get out of coming here.
Oh, he did not!
Let's do an experiment here. I get the impression this family values science. So raise your hand if you feel certain you know what was in the syringe.
Do you really not see what's happening here?
Tell me.
Well, Dr. Wong -- by the way, racist name -- obviously, Morty and Summer are seizing on your arbitrary pickle obsession as an end run around what was supposed to be their therapy.
Oh, I think this pickle incident is a better path than any other to the heart of your family's dysfunction. I think it's possible that you and your father have a very specific dynamic. I don't think it's one that rewards emotion or vulnerability. I think it may punish them. I think it's possible that dynamic eroded your marriage, and is infecting your kids with a tendency to misdirect their feelings.
Fuck you.
Fuck both of you, too.
By the way, you might notice that in spite of your numerous distinctive features, I never gave you a name like Scar or Stripe or Goliath. That's because, to me, you aren't special.
God damn it, I love myself.
Pickle Riiick!
Get that parkour. Get that parkour!
Hey, it's cool. Just need to find the nearest exit.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! No need to freak out.
Whoa! Who in the fuck's toilet is this?
What is it?
Where is it?
We have 34 armed guards, and we can't kill a pickle?
Put him on, and locate the phone he's using.
Hi, um, can you, uh  please let me out.
Your mere presence in this building violates international law.
You should know those men killed themselves.
And how is that?
They didn't  let me out.
Shut your mouth and do your jobs, you fucking children!
Uh, is this not a good time or...?
Some of my men are calling you "Solen'ya"
That'd be a lucky break for you.
Ah.
...because this pickle doesn't care about your children. And I'm not gonna take their dreams. I'm gonna take their parents.
He's just a pickle!
He's not the only one.
Then Katarina is a prisoner. Perhaps I could arrange her escape, as well. She lives, Jaguar.
What do you think is in the syringe, Beth?
You're the one that costs $200 an hour. You tell me.
Your kids think it might be anti-pickle serum.
My kids pee their desks and suck on unbaked vases.
I never said I was angry at you.
That's the point of pottery-enamel huffing, Summer. You do it so you don't have to say "I'm angry at mommy" out loud.
Oh, my God!
It's not my job to take sides or pass judgment. Do you think when your father asks for that syringe, you could ask him --
He won't have to ask for it, okay? He won't need it. He'll just make more. He doesn't need anything from anyone.
You admire him for that.
It's better than making your problems other people's problems.
Oh, come on!
You should know that isn't original.
There's nothing I won't do to see her again.
Yeah, there's lots I wouldn't do to see my daughter, but killing you gets me to her quicker than your derivative bullshit.
That will be your downfall, Jaguar, not being open to new experiences.
Jaguar couldn't make it.
Do it. Okay, you win, Pickle Man. I'm unsealing the building.
No, thanks. I'm coming for you now.
Pickle Man, there's $100 million worth of bonds in a safe on level two. I'll give you the combination.
Shut up and call me a helicopter, you prick! Do we have a deal?!
Take that money, give it to Jaguar's daughter when you set her free. Or I'll be visiting you.
Jaguar's daughter is dead.
Huh, so you're a liar.
Jaguar was an animal. You're an intelligent pickle. We can do business.
I don't think so. See you soon.
Is the helicopter here?
Tell them we were robbed.
Farewell, Solen'ya.
Well, my daughter is about five away, and I've got about eight to live.
Oh, well, uh, she knows. I mean, we don't really buy into that kind of crap, to the extent that love is an expression of familiarity over time, my access to infinite timelines precludes the necessity of attachment. In fact, I even abandoned one of my infinite daughters in an alternate version of earth that was taken over by mutants.
Huh? Uh, no. No, nope, sorry about that. Nope, just me. Yeesh!
I am afraid that my kids will get expelled.
Good. Summer, you go.
I am mad that I can't huff enamel without people assuming it's because my family sucks. I hope to be seen one day as someone that just likes getting high.
Good job. Morty, do you have an "I" statement?
I am sad that I peed. I'm sad that I peed in class instead of a toilet.
Look at this family go. You guys are pros. What do you guys think about doing this once a week?
Ugh.
You must be Rick.
Mm-hmm.
I've heard a lot about you today. Your family is crazy about you. Your daughter holds you in very high regard. You're a lucky fella.
Yeah, thank you. Uh, sweetie, you don't still happen to have that syringe in your purse?
Dad I would like you to tell me what's in the syringe.
It's a serum that I need to, uh, to stay alive. I have had a rough day. And, uh, I've sustained a lot of damage. I'm pretty close to death, which the serum will prevent.
By changing you from a pickle to a human.
Yes.
Rick, why did you lie to your daughter?
So I wouldn't have to come here.
Why didn't you want to come here?
Because I don't respect therapy, because I'm a scientist. Because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don't like something about the world, I change it. And I don't think going to a rented office in a strip mall to listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything.  I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, which is a state of mind we value in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself. I'm not a cow. I'm a pickle. When I feel like it. So...you asked.
Rick, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness.  You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse. And I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control. You chose to come here, you chose to talk -to belittle my vocation- just as you chose to become a pickle.  You are the master of your universe, and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces. Your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand.  I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy, the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass. Because the thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is it's not an adventure. There's no way to do it so wrong you might die. It's just work. And the bottom line is, some people are okay going to work, and some pee well, some people would rather die. Each of us gets to choose.
I, um I'm sorry I lied to get out of the thing. I, I shouldn't lie to you.
Oh, it's fine. I mean, thank you, and, yeah, you shouldn't. But I hope you know that's not what that session was supposed to be.
Oh, no, I mean, I know it was Morty peeing his pants and Summer snorting glue or whatever...
She huffed enamel, and we never even talked about it.
Well, there was so much more at stake. I mean, that shrink, what a monologuist.
Are we gonna go back?
Sweetie, could I get Get that syringe now?
Oh, my God, yes! Dad, it's in my purse. Oh, I'm sorry. You must be in agony.
Eh.
Jesus. Jesus Christ. Therapists, man.
Weird breed.
Man, I missed having hands and blood and a stomach.
Really? Like, go somewhere? Yeah, let's drop the kids off and go tie one on.
Absolutely.
I, I liked her.
So what are you thinking, like, Smokey's Tavern? Maybe Shoney's?
Yeah, either one. Either one.
You'll never get away with this, Concerto.
This is it, Morty. We're goners. We're not getting out of this one. After everything we've been through, this is how we're gonna die. Make peace with your god.
Oh, geez, Rick, I-I-I don't want to die!
Jaguar!
Who? Who was that, Rick?
That, Morty, is why you don't go to therapy.
Don't let any of those things get away, Morty. If their DNA gets into Earth's food chain, our entire species could be sterilized.
Then why aren't we killing them?!
Great. Next time I need a species sterilized, who's gonna do it for me? You?
Oh, Rick! I-Is that the Vindibeacon? We're being called to assemble by the Vindicators!
I refuse to answer a literal call to adventure, Morty. Let it go to voicemail!
Rick, the Vindicators only call when the universe itself is at stake! They're first line of defense against evil! They're the guardians of the unguarded!
They're the writers of their own press releases, Morty! They're a bunch of drama queens that spend an hour talking and twenty minutes jumping around while shit blows up. They're a phase. We did one, it was the big event of that summer. Let it die.
I, Morty Smith, invoke my right to choose one in every ten Rick and Morty adventures.  Read 'em and weep.
God... fuckin' dammit!  Fine! But don't say I didn't warn you.
Yes!  Vindicator command ship, beacon received! We're doing Vindicators Twoooooooooo!
Whoops! Uh, Morty, you might want to freeze some sperm.
Vindicators, Worldender is back...
..and this time, he's out to end more than worlds. We have reason to believe his stronghold is located on...
My balls.
Rick!
...the Terraneus system. Once in range, Million Ants will scan for pheromone activity, which should lead us to the location of the base.
Oh, that's Million Ants. I can't see the ants over here. It just assumed that was, uh, Turd Man. Wiggly Turd Man.
Rick, stop!
Rick, you have something to add to the briefing?
Uh, yeah, just a few more design notes.  Um, this guy. The, uh... The, uh...
Right, Crocubot. So, you're half-cold, unfeeling reptile, half-also cold, equally-unfeeling machine.
So, you're origin is what? Y-You fell into a vat of redundancy?
Noob-Noob, we're having a briefing!  If I can continue, Rick. I anticipate sophisticated security measures. I trust you can be of service there.
Well, let me check my list of powers and weaknesses. Ability to do anything... But only whenever I want... Yeah, that sounds like a job for me.
I wish he had the ability to check is attitude.
Alan Rails, ladies and gentleman. After his parents' tragic death in a railroad accident, he gained the power to summon ghiost trains. It's not all bad, though. They were spared having to see their grown son wear a whistle!
Thanks, Noob-Noob! This guy gets it.
Vance Maximus, Renegade Star Soldier!
Sorry I'm late. It was happy hour.
Happy hour.
Uh, I was also late because of my drinking and metioned it to zero applause.
Rick Sanchez, Tinkerer of Terror. Man, that's hard to say. And... Morty, right?
Whoa, yeah!
I never forget a kid.  What do you say, Vindicators? Let's make this three for three?
Did he say "three for three"?
Did he say he never forgets a kid?
You mean "two for two", right, Vance?
Actually, we assembled a second time last summer to fight Doomnomitron.
So, this is... Vindicators 3? And you guys did Vindicators 2... w-without us?
I sense... insecurity.
Are you sure there's not just a picnic nearby.
I guess he found his crowd. Pretty toothless stuff, guys.
I hope you're happy with the adventure so far, Morty. These guys are even lamer than last time.
We weren't here "last time", remember? They did a whole Vindicators without us. A bunch of them got killed, too. They lost Lady Katana, Calypso, Diablo Verde...
Yikes. Yeah, things did feel less diverse in there.
This article says the reason we weren't involved was... "personality conflicts".
Don't worry, Morty, they love you. Superheroes need a wide-eyed unremarkable to tag along and react to everything like it's mind-blowing.
I... think the personality conflict might have been... you.
Jesus... How awesome is that? I mean, they wanted to not need me so bad, they murdered three innocent heroes of color, and they still had to bring me back?
Rick, since it's my adventure and all, could you do me a favor?
Uh, the adventure is the favor, Morty. Me sleeping on these linens is the favor. I mean, w-w-w-what--what are we vindicating? Comfort?
Rick, this really bums me out. It-It's embarrassing to find out these guys don't like us.
Why? Morty,  I defeat gagoos more powerful than these guys every week.
Yeah, but not heroes.
Oh, please. They just call themselves heroes so they can...
I'm calling them that, Rick! They're my heroes! Mine!
Huh... no accounting for taste. I'm gonna go get a drink.
Oh, God.
Good morning. Looks like your grandpa had a long night. Crocubot, why don't you escort Mr. Sanchez to a more comfortable spot so that someone can...  clean up his diarrhea.
Actually, Noob-Noob, you have a new mission.
Vindicators, prepare for arrival.
Morty, the Vindicators and I had a chat this morning and I'm afraid we need to make a little change.
I-I totally get it. I-I'm so sorry.
You should be.  Running around in a yellow t-shirt like you're not one of us? Disgraceful.
I-I-I... I'm not a superhero.
Cop a squat, chief.  Everyone in the universe is a hero. All you have to do is know the difference between good and bad, and root for good.
Rick says "good" and "bad" are artificial constructs.
Yeah, well, I get the feeling... he kind of needs that to be the case.  Not coming, Noob-Noob?
Security drones, inbound.
Star Mother, grant me your wrath!
All aboard!
Aah!  Gun turret.
Are you all right?
Yes. I only lost 400 ants. My queen is laying more.  I am back to one million ants.
Someone wake up Sanchez.
Ugh! Oh, Christ...
Rick, you're up.
Barely.
Rick, we're taking fire from an automated turret. Can you bring it offline?
Uh-huh.
Uh, my God, that's better.
RICK!
Hey, I can't help if I can't see.
I could've just used a ghost train.
Really? You don't say. You would have used a ghost train?  Hey, everybody, the ghost train guy would have used a ghost train!
Man, fuck you.
Is there coffee? Hey, Morty, can you be a pal? Grandpa left his coffee maker on the ship. Y-You know, the French press thing?
Get it yourself.
Little extra  snippy this morning, aren't you?
Just focus on the mission, all right?
Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry. Oh, you're right. Ooh, real serious. Gotta take it real serious, huh?
Son of a steam engine! They're all dead!
Well, he is the Worldender. The guy ends worlds. Kind of his thing.
Ooh, real scared. Real fucking on alert, high alwrt over here.
What the FUCK?!
It's Worldender! What happened to him?
I sense his life force is fading.
Million Ants, ladies and gentleman! The ant colony with the power of two human eyes!
All right. Short mission, good mission. Remember when Alan wanted to use a ghost train? See you guys in Vindicators 4. Morty?
Rick, whoever did this is an even bigger threat than Worldender! We can't leave now!
He's right. This is far from over.
Well, have fun with that. But Morty and I have to meet a comet girl, a monorail man, two assholes and a full alligator in, like, an hour.
Shit.
I sense the presence of a greater evil.
Check, check, One, two. Okay, is it recording? Good. Hello, Vindicators. Welcome to your reckoning, babyyyyyyyy!!
Welp, it's official. I had too much to drink last night.
If you guys are watching this, you're, you know, the Vindicators. So now that we know...
Rick? What's going on, buddy?
Obviously, I came here last night during a blackout.
Obviously? You came here and defeated our arch-nemesis while so drunk, you don't remember doing it? That's something obvious to you?
Look, I'm a lit-- little more complex than you guys and, no offense, but I've always suspected that a lot of what you do in a year could be knocked out in a couple of hours.
...So I thought, why not just do your job for you so we can have a little fun game.
Rick, is-is this a "Saw" thing? Are you seriously "Saw"-ing the Vindicators?
Morty I'm a drunk, not a hack.
If you break the rules, lose the game or try to leave, you will die. Like in  "Sawwww".
Well, I-I-I think we've seen enough. I'll just figure out how to unplug this.
Okay, here we go, room number one. The Vindicators are known throughout the galaxy, but do they know yourselves? Do you know yourselves? Match your... your shit, your... your gimmicks with your faces and y-you get it, it's a matching thing. And do it in three minutes, or you'll  all die.
Screw this. I'm not playing his game. I'm gonna find us a way out of here.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, Vance. He said you'd die if you tried to leave. That means there's booby traps.
Why are you acting like that's not you?!
What part of "blackout" don't you understand? I thought you drank?
Like cool drinking! Like sexy drinking, not this psycho trailer-park shit!
Vance, stay calm...
Oh, so you're the leader now because we gave you a jacket?! You're the learning-disabled kid we do photo-ops with!
Okay, ouch, but...
Okay, this... this is triggering me. I need space. I-I need SPACE! FROM THIS!
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't crush your windpipe!
Because my epidermis is laced with a nanofiber defense mesh.
And because, like I said, I don't remember last night.
I told you not to invite this mummified motherfucker back!
Alan, I'm not proud of what's happening here, but if you keep coming at me, there's gonna be another passenger on that ghost train.
Guys!  I've figured it out.
Congrats! You did it-- it!
It was a bit. All of the descriptors apply to all of you. Drunk Rick's point is that none of you are very special or different.  That's always his point.
Let's just get through this as quickly as possible. Then, we'll deal with the two of you.
The two of us?!  I hope you're proud of yourself!
Uh, I kind of am. I saved the goddamn universe.
That's not the issue, Rick!
Ahh, it would've been if I hadn't.
The Vindicators say their job is is to fight evil wherever it hides, but they don't... pick the location you'll... you'll never even hear them mention, because to fight darkness is to fight yourself.
Crocubot, don't!
Huh, I'm seeing more croc than bot here.
Goddammit!
Uh, what happened on Dorian 5?
Nothing!
Nothing?! We exterminated a planet!
W-Wait, huh?
Doomnomitron was hiding here! He's a shapeshifter! Destroying Dorian 5 was the only way to kill him!
Oh, o-okay. This again?
You know,  I could have made a device to detect Doomnomitron from orbit like  that.
I'm not the one that didn't want you back. Alan was!
If you lay those deaths at my doorstep one more time...
Do not threaten her!
Congrats, you did it!
What the hell is Is-ra-el?
I-It's just something Rick starts talking about whenever he's blackout drunk.
W-What? In w--In w-w-what--In what way? Like, w-w-what's my point?
In a way that has no point! You just babble about defense budgets and the United Nations, and then you pass out!
So, to be clear, I sometimes reference the geopolitical complexities of the topic, which is not the same as going to an anti-Semitic place.
I have no stake in this.
I don't either. I-I'm just saying, if anything, the drunk version of me is probably so supportive of Israel, he wants what's best for it and...
Hey, man, I'm not touching this. You do you.
Aloha... means hello and goodbye in Hawaii. But, uh, aloha means... has nothing to do with this room.  I'm so fucking drunk. Ugh, okay, here's the deal. I-I want to rest my eyes for a little bit. I'm--I'm not going to sleep. I just... just need to rest my eye, so let's make this one simple. Just try to hit some three-pointers.
let's say... you have to hit... five three-pointers in... five minutes or, I don't know, the whole place--the whole planet will get blown up with a n-neutrino bomb. And try to make it a-a lesson about yourselves like, like how... selfish you a-are, or something. Also, Hawaii.
You guys hit the baskets. I'll disarm the drunkenly-improvised neutrino bomb. There's a 40% chance it's a dud, but y-you should still stay back.
Morty, how many of these...?
Too many, Rick! Too many!
Man, I am really getting high-roaded today.
That's a three-pointer!
Nice shot.
Thank you.
You two make quite a team.
We all do.
Yeah, I guess.
That's a three-pointer!
But you guys have always had a... an unspoken bond.
I mean, really unspoken. Like, "let's-not-tell-my-husband" unspoken.
We aren't married anymore, Alan.
Sure, but were we married when you two were "stranded" on Delphi 6 for three days? Because I sensed something was weird when you can back. But what do I know about sensitivity? I'm just a phantom train conductor. You're the pile of ordinary bugs that fucked my wife!
That's a three-pointer!
Where the fuck is the lead wire?!
You always put it in the weirdest place! Um, uh, over here, maybe?
Jesus Christ, what a shitty neutrino bomb. it's a miracle I actually every destroy anything.
Oh, I don't know. You managed to destroy just about everything today; the villains, the heroes, the lines between them, my childhood...
Thank you. I appreciate it, Morty. I know you were sucking the Kool-Aid out of the Vindicators' dicks, so the fact that I was right about them must be pretty hard to admit.
Yeah, it is. You know why, Rick? Because when you're an asshole, it doesn't matter how right you are, nobody wants to give you the satisfaction.
I know. Everyone wants people they like to be right. That's why popular people are fucking dumb. And why your pretentious, poorly-written, high-budget friends back there can a eat a double-decker shit sandwich.  Disarmed.
Holy shit. You're jealous.
YES! Is that what you want to hear?!
Did it feel good?! Did you like his six million wriggling legs more than my tragedy-stricken, half-ghost, half-tumescent penis?!
That's a three-pointer!
Guys, stop! You're just proving my asshole grandpa right!
You wish this was about sex! We loved each other! We had a child together.
WHAT?!
I conceived a child with Million Ants and it died inside me because it as HALF A MILLION ANTS AND HALF COLLAPSING STAR! And yes, he was better than you!
Yeah?
One million times better!
ALL ABOOOOOOARD, MOTHERFUCKER!!!
STOP!
Oof! Didn't see that comin'.
Is that sarcasm?!  I don't want you slipping away then this is over! All of these deaths are on your hands!
Oh, come on, maybe a couple of them, but definitely not the train guy.
All of them.
O-kayyy...
Congrats, you did it!
All right, buy now, I've been pretty clear that I thunk the Vindicators are  full of shit. But... you do have one thing I'll never have. And that thing is the only part of the Vindicators with any value to me. if you know what it is, place it on the platform.Guess wrong and the pla... planet will explode. And probably the solar system, 'cause I kind of fucking eyeballed the neutrino bombs on this one.
So what's the trick? Morty, you're the Drunk Rick expert.
I think... no matter what we put on there, we die. he said it's the part of the Vindicators he values. That means nothing. He wants our last moment alive to be spent knowing how few fucks he gave.
Jesus! Okay, open to second opinions!
I could--It could be Morty.
What?
Hey, I don't know. I mean, look, when I get drunk, I get stupid and emotional and there's no logic to it. it's, like, possible I got so drunk, I felt like I was losing Morty to the Vindicators, and maybe this is my way of saying "Okay, you can have him, but only if you know how important he is, otherwise I'll kill you."
That is a... really specific guess.
Look, I... there's nothing in the room but us. I'm just using logic to connect some dots. It's the best guess I've got.
But you're betting our lives on it.
I'll cover that bet. I get it.
Well, Morty, I think you're making that smirky face because you're misinterpreting the moment. I am not being coy about some hidden love for you. I want to be really clear that, if anyone has a better guess, like, if I gave you an amulet last night, or...
Oh, shit.
Sorry, I'm... not good at goodbyes. It looks like I'm never gonna see you again. I can't really roll with the hero types, and I don't... th-they don't want me around. But I want... you to know, even if I didn't show it at the time, II really appreciated you sticking by me.
Goddammit, why am I crying? It makes no sense.
Ugh, y-you're probably confused because we barely know each other...
...but you really stuck your neck out  when you gave me props for my awesome jokes in the briefing room. Everybody else had their heads so far up their ass. Even my own grandson is like, "Oh, the Vindicators are so cool." I mean, he's a moron, it's their... demographic. But you're different, Noob-Noob.
...Motherfucker!
You're fucking cool! And you're smart! And I bet we coulda hung out and shit! And I hope you get to be a full-fledged Vindicator! A-And d-do me a favor. Do-Don't let him know I... I got emotional. But you can tell him one thing. Tell him I said... Oh, fuck. Okay, I just shit myself. Okay, later.
W--Dude, Morty, what happened i...?
Shut up.
I sense this means we are not drying.
Not all of us.
Sweetheart?
Just let Titty-Bean do this, Snuzzles. It's for the greater good.
Greater good?!
Titty-Bean?
It's like you said, Morty
Never said that!
It's the galaxy's faith in the Vindicators that keeps the galaxy secure!
Yeah, I feel safer already.
No doubt. Who do we make the check out to?
I'll say, we are gettin' some good licks in while choking to death.
Right?
Titty-Bean, listen to me. When you came to me, I was merely a sentient colony of ants. It was your beliefs, your pursuit of justice, that taught me to be a man.
When did it get so complicated?
Who knows? But we can make it simple again.
You were always the romantic.  Which is why you can't leave either.
Goodbye, my love.
Damn! She double-crossed Snuzzles!
Silence! I'm going to enjoy this...
Let's give a huge thanks to Rick Sanchez for killing Worldender, putting this awesome party together, and for booking one of the hottest talents out there
Look at that. Geez, I must've planned a whole party. Invited a bunch of people. Not bad, Drunk Rick, not bad.
Rick, Supernova's getting away!
Ah, who cares?
But.. she was trying to kill us!
Morty, twenty people try to kill me every week. I end up getting high with half of 'em. I mean, check it out, Gear Head's here.
Morty, you're wearing a Vindicator jacket. Are you a little superhero now?
Everyone in the universe is a hero, Mom. Which is why we don't need jackets.  And I'm pretty sure we don't need Vindicators.
Man, Grandpa Rick must have gotten shitfaced.
Shut up, Summer.
Who the fuck is Noob-Noob?
Alright, Morty. You ready for our adventure to the lost city of Atlantis?
Ready as I’ll ever be, Rick!
Oh, for fuck’s sake.
What are you, stupid? We’re done with the Citadel of Ricks. I was  never on board with it in the first place, that’s why I murdered everyone in charge and left it to rot.
They tried to murder him first.
Yeah, he knows. He murdered them.
Every day.
You don’t have to be a dick.
Geez. I didn’t know there were still Ricks and Mortys living on the Citadel. I wonder what their day-to-day lives are like.
Well, you can keep wondering that while we go on our fun, fresh, self-contained adventure to Atlantis.  Anyone continuing to explore the Citadel is either stupid, or one of the unfortunate millions held hostage by their terrible ideas.
Man. Glad I’m not one of them!
Sixteen iterations off the central finite curve, there’s a Rick that works more with wood than polarity plating.
His name is Simple Rick, but he’s no dummy.
He realized long ago that the greatest thing he’d ever create was his daughter.
We captured that moment and run it on a loop through Simple Rick’s mind.
And the chemical that makes his brain secrete goes into every Simple Rick’s Simple Wafer Cookie.  Come home to the impossible flavor of your own completion. Come home to Simple Rick’s.
We had a good run, sir, but I think it’s time to pull out of the race.
I feel pretty confident about tonight’s debate.
You shouldn’t, sir. You should be terrified.
Maybe you should find a little faith, young man.
You don’t pay me to have faith! And we’re the same age!
Oh! S-sorry, I was expecting--
A Rick partner? Lesson one, rookie
Mortys are human!
Get the fuck off the car, you Rickless fuckin’ animal!
WHOA!!
The election’s got these yellow shirts more riled up than a Picture Day Jessica.
That’s pretty harsh, sir.
So report me. Nobody gives a fuck.
Look, I’m just saying. Makes me a little sad to hear a Morty cop calling Mortys “animals”.
Well, it makes me sad to see another Rick cop buying into his sensitivity training.
Well, I’m glad to know there’s more like me.
Oh, there was one. Why do you think that seat was empty?
Fifth and ? That’s Mortytown.
Unit 7 responding.
"Good idea, Rick."
"This is a great adventure."
"I love being your new Morty."
Farty!
Very amusing, Mr. Smith. Almost as amusing as when your first Rick was decapitated on Zorpathion 9.  Or was that your third Rick? How many Ricks have you had?
Five…
I see. So you are top of the class in something.  Tomorrow you will be transferred to your new Ricks. Hopefully, they will be your last. Yes, Slow Ri-- Tall Morty?
Anything’s possible, Tall Morty. Ugh…
Guess we won’t be seein’ each other after this, huh?
I say we make our last day count. I say… we go to the Wishing Portal.
That’s a myth.
If we’re not here for graduation, our butts are gonna end up in Mortytown.
I thought your last Rick fused you with a lizard, not a chicken.
Okay, fine. I’m in.
Me too.
I-I thought I saw a fly.
No Ricks, no families, high off their asses and runnin’ amok. Mortys are raised to be sidekicks. Without a side to kick, they just start kickin’.
Yeah, make sure you get that down.
Any mutations? Augmentations? Three eyes, a tail, maybe a buzzcut?
Lemme turn over a few rocks.
Aw geez, hey, what’s goin’ on, fellas?
Aw geez, man, nothin’ man, we’re just hangin’ out and stuff.
I hear that, ah geez, I guess I’m supposed to be figuring out who robbed the store across the street but aw geez I dunno.
Ah geez man, that sucks that your Rick’s makin’ you do that.
He’s not my Rick. He’s my partner. Aw, geez.
Well, maybe the uniform makes a big difference. Who am I to say? To me, you just look like a sidekick.
CALL ME A SIDEKICK ONE MORE TIME! CALL ME A SIDEKICK!!
Hey man! C’mon, aw geez!
WANNA SEE HOW I PAINT A WALL?!
It was the Mortytown Locos, man! The Mortytown Locos!
Do you realize how many codes you just violated?
Aw geez, Rick. What do I know about knowin’ stuff? Get in the fucking car.
Can we fact-check this, please? Never mind, who am I kidding? This race is over.
I don’t see a divide between Ricks and Mortys.
You guys finished?  The division I see is between the Ricks and Mortys that like the Citadel divided, and the rest of us. I see it everywhere I go.
I see it in our schools, where they teach Mortys we’re all the same because they’re threatened by what makes us unique.
I see it in our streets, where they give guns to Mortys so we’re too busy fighting each other to fight real injustice.
I see it in our factories, where Ricks work for a fraction of their boss’s salary, even though they’re identical and have the same IQ. The Citadel’s problem isn’t homeless Mortys or outraged Ricks.
The Citadel’s problem is the Ricks and Mortys feeding on the Citadel’s debt.
Holy shit.
But I’ve got a message for them, from the Ricks and Mortys keeping it alive. A message… from the Ricks and Mortys that believe in this Citadel to the Ricks and Mortys that don’t
Holy shit.  I don’t believe it! I-I can’t believe it!
I know.  That’s why you’re fired.
Your life is a lie, man.  All your lives are lies! Don’t you get it?! They told us we were special because we were Ricks, but they stripped us of anything that made us unique!
I-I-I want a portal gun. Unregistered, untraceable, with enough fluid to take me off this goddamn prison!
Yes?
Gosh. We moved around so much it’s hard to remember. I see every Rick as my Rick.
I hope they see me as their Morty.
Another, please, with less water.
I guess I shoulda had more faith.
What’s this?
Hands in the air!
You guys doin’ a little chemistry homework with Grandpa?
Is this what I think it is?
Bootleg portal fluid.
Guess his math was off. Search the place.
It’s okay, Morty.
Jesus!
He stabbed me! He got me bad, Morty.
Shh, it’s okay, you’re okay.
You were right…  Everything I learned in the academy was--
It doesn’t matter.  Nothing’s wrong with putting your faith in a Morty. You just gotta pick the right one.
Why is there a crib in here?
Just somethin’ they do to make you feel bad.
Boy, I got us knee-deep in paperwork, huh?
Go to the car and grab a MediPack. Lemme worry about this.
What happened?
Same old story. Mortys killing Mortys.
Almost... got it...
I bet it leads to a place where a bunch of fri-- flies everywhere!
Yeah, I bet it goes nowhere. I bet it's a big hole where the Citadel dumps all its broken dreams.
You wanna know why?  Because of this! I'm part of an experimental line of Mortys with a trauma implant. How do you think it feels, Fat Morty, to know that no matter where I go,  I'll always be the one that makes everybody sad and... a little bored?
Slick, that implant isn't who you are, okay? You also roll up your sleeves.
Then you should use your left hand to eat more vegetables.
Hey there. How you doing? Great to meet you.
That doesn't sound like Rick work. You didn't come to the Citadel to be a plumber, did you?
This is just like a Morty baby!
Hey!  Did you end up getting a new job?
Yeah, I did. Assassinating you!
I'm okay... I'm okay... I'm...  Ohh...
No thank you, and bad math.
What is the place?
"The Creepy Morty". What is it your kind's always saying? "Don't think about it." Come on. There's someone important I want you to meet.
They had a little accident. They won't be causing any trouble anymore.
Big Morty likes to contribute to keeping the peace in Mortytown.  Think of him as a drug lord, and us his cops on his payroll.
Morty...
M-m-my partner. Morty, you're right. Mortytown is bad, but that doesn't mean that we have to be.
Don't worry about Rick, Big Morty. He's new. He doesn't understand how it works.
Wh-why would you say something like that, Big Morty? You're fucking things up for both of us here!
Big Morty, you're under arrest.
S-smartest man in the universe.
Not so big now, are ya?
That's enough!
If we don't kill him, he'll talk!
If you do, I'll talk.
You told me to put my faith in the right Morty. I got faith in you, partner. Do the right thing.
Oh, Grandpa Rick! I don't wanna be on the Citadel anymore! I want to be a regular kid! I want to go to school and throw balls around and masturbate!
Same old story. Ricks killing Mortys.
A bad place, but you're going to a better one soon.
A portal to the Blender Dimension?! That's the oldest trick in the book! I'm a Rick! I'm more Rick than any of you!!
Then come and get me, motherfuckers!!
Rick. And I'm--
Fifteen years.
Where are we going?
There's a Rick who held a factory hostage after murdering his boss and several co-workers. The factory made cookies, flavored him with lies.
He made us all take a look at what we were doing, and at the bargain he got a taste of real freedom.
We captured that taste, and we keep giving it to him so he can give it right back to you, in every bite of new Simple Rick Freedom Wafer Selects.  Come home to the unique flavor of shattering the grand illusion. Come home to Simple Rick.
After you.
I guess I wish I had something cooler than this dumbass surfer necklace.
I wish incest porn h-had a more mainstream appeal, f-for a friend of mine.
None of those things are gonna happen, y'know. Morty wishes never come true. Not on the Citadel.
Then why did you bring us here?
Because I wish that would change. I wish anything about this life would change.
Well, I hope you're putting something pretty goddamn important in there.
Me, too. But I doubt it.
NOOOOOOOO!!!!
SLI-I-I-I-I-I-I-ICK!!!!
Maybe... Maybe he went somewhere nice.
He gotta be stopped...  He-he cou-couldn't be allowed to win.
He's alive?! No, no, no! You gotta listen to me!  I-I worked for him! I was his campaign manager! That Morty is not what he seems.
He... won?
Why am I still here? I already confessed to everything.
But... I violated at least a dozen departmental codes!
Did we miss graduation? Where are the new Ricks?
No graduation. No new Ricks. The school's curriculum is changing.
To what?
I don't know, and I don't have to know. I've been fired.  Good luck, turds.
Holy crap... Slick's wish came true.
Whoa!! Hahaha, yeah! Atlantis, baby!
That was amazing!
Got some of that mermaid puss!
I'm really hoping it wasn't a one-off thing and I can see her again. By the way, hey, um... still not curious about what might've happened at that crazy Citadel place?
Pssh! Not at all, Morty. That place will never have any bearing over our lives ever again. Unlike that mermaid puss! Yeah!! We're going back for seconds! We're gonna do that shit every week, man! That was Atlantis!
Whoo! Yeah! Yeaah! Ohhh, shit!
Whoo! Yeah!
